IN THE WAR ZONE</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE JOURNEY TO RUSSIA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="dropcap">After the Porter brothers, Sidney
and Raymond, had escaped from
Mexico in their flight from Mexican rebels,
they proceeded as rapidly as possible to
their El Paso home. There they found their
father, who had succeeded, several weeks
before, in reaching El Paso from Chihuahua.</p>

<p>Mrs. Porter declared that the boys should
then remain at home, at least until they had
ceased to be boys. She said that her nerves
were not equal to another such strain as
they had endured while the boys were in
the wilds of Mexico, and that she would
have no more wandering in dangerous foreign
lands.</p>

<p>Her husband reminded her, however, that
there seemed to be nothing in the boys’
recent adventure that would justify so<span class="pagenum">[2]</span>
drastic a prohibition. The boys had successfully
made a difficult journey without harm,
and had proved that they were quite able
to take care of themselves under unusual
conditions of great danger, as he had all
along maintained that they were.</p>

<p>There was no question, though, of their
going back to the Mexican mine. The entire
State of Chihuahua was so unsettled
by the frequent changes of the revolution
that even Mr. Porter admitted it would be
the wildest folly to attempt to return there.
So the boys entered the El Paso High School
for the rest of that year and the next, and
their father gradually reconciled himself to
the idea of losing his entire Mexican investments.</p>

<p>It was difficult for Mr. Porter to settle
down quietly at home, where he had no regular
business, and, moreover, he possessed
in a high degree the American mania for
travel. The result was, that one year of
inactivity was as much as he could endure,
and as the second summer approached he
began to long for a change of scene. Being
cut off from his accustomed Mexican stamping
ground, he was forced to look farther<span class="pagenum">[3]</span>
afield. One day he read an account of the
great Russian Fair at Nizhni-Novgorod and
that reminded him that he had long wished
to visit that wonderful mart. So he proposed
that the entire family should make
the trip. It would, he said, be a liberal
education for the boys, and it was providential
that the date of the Fair and their
summer vacation exactly coincided.</p>

<p>Mrs. Porter was plunged in despair at
the proposal, for to penetrate to the interior
of Russia seemed to her like invading one of
the wildest and most impossible countries
on earth. In vain her husband assured her
that Russian hotels were notoriously comfortable,
and that, indeed, to attain comfort
in every department of his living was the
ideal of the Russian. To begin with, there
was no more delightful course of ocean
travel than that supplied by the steamers
of the Russian-American line from New
York to Libau. And to visit any of the
peaceful countries of Europe was a very
different matter, anyway, from a journey
in strife-broken Mexico. Mr. Porter was
obliged to admit that it would necessitate
a long journey, but he was sure every part<span class="pagenum">[4]</span>
of it would be so delightful that his wife
would never regret having gone.</p>

<p>Mrs. Porter was not in the least convinced,
but experience had taught her that
when her husband once fixed his mind on a
thing he seldom gave it up, so she proposed
a compromise. She would make one of the
party as far as New York, but would remain
there with her sister, whom she had
long wished to visit, until Mr. Porter and
the boys returned in September.</p>

<p>The boys were clamorous that their
mother should go with them, and reminded
her of the Eastern silks and rugs which she
would undoubtedly see, and might buy, at
the Fair. They also made a great deal of
the delightful long voyage, knowing their
mother’s enjoyment of the water; but Mrs.
Porter remained firm, and it was finally arranged
as she had suggested.</p>

<p>In a very short time, really, though it
seemed an age to the impatient boys, they
were on the pier in New York ready to
board the fine steamer Kursk for Libau,
Russia. Mrs. Porter gave the boys final
instructions about their clothes, and told
them just where, in their trunk, she had<span class="pagenum">[5]</span>
placed the box of sewing materials. The
boys, besides being crack shots with the
rifle and six-shooter, an accomplishment
which they had found so valuable in their
Mexican adventure, could replace missing
buttons, sew up ripped seams, and even
put on patches, if necessary.</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Raymond, “I <em>wish</em> we had
brought our rifles, though I don’t suppose
we should be allowed to use them anywhere.
But, mother, if we <em>should</em> get switched off
into mountains where we couldn’t send
you word, you mustn’t be alarmed if you
don’t hear from us for a long time.”</p>

<p>“If I thought anything of that sort would
happen,” said his mother with a worried
look, “I should refuse now to let you
go.”</p>

<p>“Ray is talking wild, as usual,” said Mr.
Porter. “We are going by rail direct from
Libau to Nizhni-Novgorod, and then back
by way of St. Petersburg. I imagine there
will not be much chance for a wild mountain
trip on that route.”</p>

<p>“I wish it were a mountain trip, though,”
said Raymond.</p>

<p>“I guess we’ll have to travel in a civilized<span class="pagenum">[6]</span>
way this time, Ray,” said his brother,
“and I believe I shall enjoy it more.”</p>

<p>“I am sure,” said Mrs. Porter, “there
will be no war, as there was in Mexico, so I
don’t see how you can get into any trouble.”</p>

<p>“Of course we shall not get into any
trouble, my dear,” replied her husband.</p>

<p>“I told father,” said Sidney, “that we
ought to go through Germany, to give him
a chance to use his German.”</p>

<p>Mr. Porter’s mother had been a native
German, and she had insisted that her boy,
during his childhood at home, should speak
her tongue. Learning the language in that
way he had never known any difference
between it and English. He had not, however,
been as wise as his mother, and had
not taught it to his own boys.</p>

<p>“I should like to do that,” said Mr. Porter,
“but it would take too long; you boys
would not get back in time for school.”</p>

<p>“Which wouldn’t bother me any,” declared
Raymond.</p>

<p>The last good-byes were finally said and
the travelers stood on deck waving their
handkerchiefs to Mrs. Porter on the fast-receding
pier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[7]</span></p>

<p>While the boys had been great travelers
by land, they had never before made a long
ocean voyage and the novel scenes and sensations
were of constant interest to them.
The greatest interest began, however, after
the ship had traversed the English Channel
and had passed through the Strait of Dover
into the North Sea. There the ships which
they encountered were numerous and made
a pleasant variety after the broad expanse
of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>On the eighth day after leaving New York
they made the port of Rotterdam and the
boys could give a day to quaint Dutch
scenes. Then came the delightful voyage
up the North Sea, around the north end of
Denmark, through the narrow strait into
the Baltic and to their destination, Libau,
three days packed full of pleasure and
charm.</p>

<p>With the Great Fair in prospect there
was little in Libau to detain the travelers
and at the earliest possible moment they
were aboard a train for Nizhni-Novgorod
with three days of what they feared would
be tiresome travel ahead of them. But the
boys found, to their delight, that in the<span class="pagenum">[8]</span>
first-class coach they were given a compartment
for three. As Raymond said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“It’s just like having a private car.”</p>

<p>“And we even have our own bedding,”
said Sidney, “which makes it still more
private.”</p>

<p>They had followed Baedeker’s instructions
and had provided themselves with
traveling-rugs and pillows, which is the wisest
course to pursue on Russian railways.</p>

<p>However, even the charms of a private
car may become tiresome, and all the party
were glad when, on the afternoon of August
1, their train pulled into Nizhni-Novgorod.
That city is situated along the right bank
of the Volga River, and of its great tributary,
the Oka. The most important part of
the city is on the high bluff that borders the
two rivers along that side, and the hotel
which our travelers selected was on the bluff
near the Kremlin.</p>

<p>Climbing the bluff in a cab they had tantalizing
glimpses of the magnificent view,
and the boys did not want to go into the
hotel until they had seen more of it. Their
father, however, suggested that they had
better help him select rooms. When that<span class="pagenum">[9]</span>
was accomplished and they were alone Mr.
Porter said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I asked you to stay, boys, because I
want to arrange an important matter. I
think I should make a better disposition of
our money; it does not seem to me wise for
me to carry it all.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be bothered with money,
father,” expostulated Raymond.</p>

<p>“I think you ought to have a reasonable
amount, though,” said his father. “You
might want some badly when you were not
with me.”</p>

<p>“I would rather have some,” said Sidney.
“We should have been up a stump in Mexico,
Ray, if we hadn’t been able to use Ramon’s
money.”</p>

<p>“What I propose is this,” said Mr. Porter:
“I will turn over two hundred dollars
to you, Sidney, and one hundred dollars to
Raymond. I will keep a couple of hundred
myself and will place two hundred dollars
in the trunk. I think I had better divide
my express checks with you, Sidney, too,
and I will place a portion of those in the
trunk.”</p>

<p>“Now that’s fixed up, let’s hurry out,”<span class="pagenum">[10]</span>
urged Raymond. “I want to see that view
before dark.”</p>

<p>Mr. Porter insisted on dividing the money
and checks first, but when that was done
they went out to the Alexander Gardens,
near by.</p>

<p>While there are high bluffs along the right
banks of the Volga and the Oka, on the opposite
side extend level plains. From the Gardens
the travelers saw at their feet the two
broad rivers, and on the peninsula formed
by the junction of the two streams was
situated the great temporary city of the
Fair, connected with Nizhni-Novgorod by a
bridge of pontoons, transitory, like the community
it served.</p>

<p>Beyond the Volga stretched plains, farther
than the eye could reach toward the Urals,
hundreds of miles of cultivated fields and
meadows.</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Raymond, “that looks
like Russia, all right, without any limit.”</p>

<p>“It is evident that one must travel in
Russia,” said his father, “to comprehend
the size of the country.”</p>

<p>“Those plains look broader, somehow,
than our own Western prairies,” said Sidney,<span class="pagenum">[11]</span>
“but I guess it’s because we know they
are bigger, for often we can’t see across
ours.”</p>

<p>Near them stood a gentleman who was
also regarding the view. He must have
understood what had been said in English,
though he turned to Mr. Porter and spoke
in German.</p>

<p>“We Russians are used to vast expanses
of country, and a view like this has a great
charm for me. I have often wished that I
might see the American plains; they must
be wonderful.”</p>

<p>“The American plains, no less than the
American mountains, are wonderful,” replied
Mr. Porter in German. “But then,
America is a wonderful country.”</p>

<p>“And the Americans are a wonderful people,”
said the stranger. “They have accomplished
marvels in an incredibly short time.
Are many of them linguists like yourself?”</p>

<p>“I can hardly be called a linguist,” replied
Mr. Porter. “I speak only German
besides English. My mother was German.”</p>

<p>“Ah, your mother was German?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mr. Porter, surprised at the
rather significant tone of the stranger’s voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[12]</span></p>

<p>A policeman who stood a short distance
away, approached in response to an almost
imperceptible signal from the gentleman
and placed himself at Mr. Porter’s side.</p>

<p>“Will you have the kindness to come with
me?” said the gentleman; “there is some
business that I wish to transact with you.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear sir,” said Mr. Porter,
“why should I go with you, who are a stranger
to me? I must beg you to excuse me.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry that I cannot accept an excuse,”
said the other, very courteously; “it
is absolutely necessary that you should go
with me.”</p>

<p>Mr. Porter saw that he was probably
being placed under arrest, and concluded
it was for political reasons of some sort.
Though he believed that any objection on his
part would be futile, he determined to make
an attempt to at least obtain information.</p>

<p>“I beg of you the favor of an explanation,”
he said.</p>

<p>“I cannot give you an explanation,” replied
the other, “and I must request you
to come with me at once.”</p>

<p>“I have a passport issued from the office
of the Secretary of State, at Washington.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[13]</span></p>

<p>“That will be examined later.”</p>

<p>“May I not appeal to the American Consul,
if there be one here?”</p>

<p>“The United States has no representative
here.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir, I suppose at least my sons may
go with me.”</p>

<p>“It is not desired to detain the young
men,” replied the gentleman with considerable
impatience. “You must come with
me at once.” And he said something in Russian
to the officer, who stepped up and
placed a hand on Mr. Porter’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Sidney,” said Mr. Porter as he was being
led away, “I am arrested, but this man will
not tell me why. I believe I can clear myself
of any suspicion, but of course I can’t
be sure. You boys go back to the hotel and
I will try to send you word. Don’t follow
me, it would not be allowed. Good-bye;
keep a stiff upper lip.”</p>

anything that was said, had
listened in great suspense to the conversation
between their father and the stranger.
At first they had supposed the gentleman’s
remarks were merely politely casual. They
were made uneasy when he began to show
impatience, and when the policeman stationed
himself at their father’s side their
wonder and fear grew. They recalled tales
of arbitrary Russian political oppression,
and imagined they were all about to be
thrown into a dungeon. Their dismay was
hardly allayed by their father’s brief explanation
as he was hurried away, and there was
only time for Sidney to call after him,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about us, father.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Porter had disappeared with
the officer, and the man who was, apparently,
the officer’s superior, the boys were
left gazing at each other in consternation.
The whole affair had occupied so little time<span class="pagenum">[15]</span>
that they were dazed, and could hardly believe
that it was reality and not a dream.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t that jar you, Sid!” exclaimed
Raymond finally. “What do you suppose
they have arrested father for?”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine,” replied Sidney. “It
must be a mistake. I am sure he will be released
right away.”</p>

<p>“I guess mother was right when she
thought Russia was a dangerous country;
here we’ve come straight from the ship without
stopping anywhere, and couldn’t have
done any mischief if we had wanted to, and
yet father has been arrested before we have
been here an hour.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sidney, “it will probably
come out all right, and we will be laughing
about it to-morrow. But we’d better go
back to the hotel, so if father sends a message
we shall be there to receive it, or maybe
he will come himself.”</p>

<p>With that idea to encourage them, the
boys hurried back to the hotel and went
directly to their room. Mr. Porter had selected
connecting rooms, and their one trunk
was placed in the room which he had expected
to occupy. When the boys entered<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>
they found a man in uniform directing the
removal of the trunk by two porters.</p>

<p>“Has my father sent for his trunk?”
asked Sidney eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the officer with an amused
smile, and in English with a strong foreign
accent, “he has sent for the trunk.”</p>

<p>“Did he send us any message?”</p>

<p>“No; he sent no message.”</p>

<p>Meantime the men had carried the trunk
out into the corridor, and the boys followed
in their eagerness to get news of
their father. The officer turned and said
sharply,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Do not follow. Remain here.”</p>

<p>The boys stopped with the sensation of
having received a blow, and returned to
their rooms feeling very forlorn. There
everything looked cheerful and homelike.
The windows were suffused with the soft
light of late evening in a high latitude, and
the prevailing aspect was so peaceful that
they were more than ever inclined to think
they were dreaming. When they looked
about them, however, and saw the trunk was
gone, the reality of the situation returned.
When they had come from the train the<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>
traveling-rugs and pillows had been thrown
across a couch, and there they still lay, not
having been noticed by the men who took
the trunk. Mr. Porter’s handbag was gone,
but a small one which Sidney had carried
was on the dresser in the boys’ room. That
bag and the rugs were all that remained of
their belongings.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe father sent for his trunk,”
said Raymond; “the authorities have simply
seized it.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that is so,” replied Sidney;
“but I can’t think of any reason unless there
has been a mistake, and father has been
taken for some one else. Let’s go down to
the office; the man there speaks English, and
we may learn something.”</p>

<p>Accordingly they descended to the office
and found the English-speaking clerk.</p>

<p>“Do you know the officer who just went
out with our trunk?” asked Sidney.</p>

<p>The clerk looked at him hesitatingly for a
moment without replying; then after a cautious
glance about the lobby, where there
happened to be no one within hearing, he
said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“You are not Germans, are you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[18]</span></p>

<p>“Of course not,” replied Sidney; “we are
Americans.”</p>

<p>“But your father speaks German.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he does, but we don’t. His mother
was German.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” and the man shook his head dubiously;
“Germans will not be safe in Russia
now.”</p>

<p>“But we are not Germans,” protested
Sidney. “Anyhow, why should they not be
safe here now?”</p>

<p>“On account of the war.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there was a war.”</p>

<p>“Germany declared war on Russia to-day.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what is the matter, Ray!”
&mdash;and Sidney turned to his brother excitedly.
“They think father is German because
he speaks the language. But they must
have known before that he speaks German,
for that man who spoke to him in the park
must have had everything arranged to arrest
him.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you remember, Sid, that father
replied in German to a man who asked him
some question when we left the train?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe he did. I am greatly relieved,<span class="pagenum">[19]</span>
Ray, for I am sure father can prove
he is American. He will show his passport
and that will settle it.”</p>

<p>“Your father’s passport is here in the
safe,” said the clerk.</p>

<p>“Did the officer who arrested father see
it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he examined it before he followed
your father to the park.”</p>

<p>“And yet they arrested him!” exclaimed
Sidney.</p>

<p>“Many Germans,” said the clerk, “will
be coming from America now, and some
might come directly here as spies.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean they have taken my father
for a spy?” And a vision of Major André
of Revolutionary times rose before the horrified
boy, whose face turned pale at the
thought.</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said the clerk, looking
with pity at the distressed boys; “but I
would advise you to wait quietly and your
father may return in the morning.”</p>

<p>That seemed to be good advice and the
boys determined to follow it. It was then
time for dinner and they tried to eat something,
but with poor success. They were so<span class="pagenum">[20]</span>
uneasy about their father that they could
hardly think of anything else, and they had
not yet begun to consider what they, themselves,
should do. All thought of the Great
Fair, which they had come so far to see, had
entirely left their minds. Their trouble,
however, did not prevent them from sleeping
well, and when they went to bed they
knew nothing more until long past daylight
the next morning.</p>

<p>After such a night’s rest things did not
appear so bad to the boys as they had
seemed the day before, and they ate a
hearty breakfast. Then they hunted up the
English-speaking clerk again, for they had
received no message from their father. That
person could tell them nothing and they
went out on the street. The evening before
they had noticed nothing unusual in conditions,
or if there had appeared to be great
activity, they had supposed it was only the
ordinary business of the city. With their
knowledge that war had been declared, however,
the boys plainly perceived an air of
suppressed excitement everywhere. Automobiles
raced through the streets, and the
boys noticed that the cars always carried<span class="pagenum">[21]</span>
men in uniform. Private automobiles seemed
to have strangely disappeared, and the boys
did not know that all such cars had been
commandeered by the Government.</p>

<p>There were groups of people talking earnestly
on the streets, but not a word that the
boys heard could they understand, and they
felt very much out of everything and very
forlorn. In their far Southwestern home
their ability to speak Spanish besides their
native English had been all that they ever
needed, but in Nizhni-Novgorod both English
and Spanish seemed to be unknown.
They felt finally that they could no longer
endure the suspense of not knowing what
was being done, and determined to return
to the hotel and seek their English-speaking
friend again.</p>

<p>“Has our father sent us any message?”
asked Sidney when they had found the clerk.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the man; “we have heard
nothing from him, and I think you young
gentlemen ought to leave the city at once.
If you stay much longer you may not be
able to get out of the city at all.”</p>

<p>“How can we go,” cried Raymond, “and
leave our father here in prison?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[22]</span></p>

<p>“You cannot help him by remaining,”
said the man; “and when he is released he
will come here and will learn where you are
gone.”</p>

<p>“I think that is right, Ray,” said Sidney;
“and I am sure father would want us to get
away where we shall be safe. We had better
take the first train back to Libau and then
sail for New York by the first ship. Mother
must be feeling pretty anxious, for she probably
knows a good deal more about the war
than we do. When is there a train for Libau?”
&mdash;and Sidney turned to the clerk.</p>

<p>“You cannot go to Libau; the Government
has taken all trains to transport troops.
You cannot go either west or north from
here.”</p>

<p>“Then we can’t get away at all,” declared
Raymond petulantly. “Why did you advise
us to go?”</p>

<p>“You can go by boat down the Volga and
across the mountains to the Black Sea. You
would be almost sure to find either American
or English ships there.”</p>

<p>“Would it be difficult to cross the mountains?”
asked Sidney.</p>

<p>“Not very; there is an excellent road by<span class="pagenum">[23]</span>
the Dariel Pass, the Georgia military road.
I have been through there.”</p>

<p>“But how are we going to get away?”
asked Sidney dolefully. “I have heard that
one cannot move a step in Russia without a
passport, and we can’t take my father’s passport,
for he will need that when he is released.”</p>

<p>“No,” said the clerk; “we could not let
you have this passport, which is made out
in your father’s name, but I think I would
be allowed to take it down to the boat and
show it to the purser, who would probably
be satisfied with that.”</p>

<p>“What should we do when we had to
make a change, and would need to show a
passport again?”</p>

<p>“There are steamers here that bring up
petroleum from the Caspian ports of the
Caucasus. Some of them carry passengers,
and I think I can find a boat that will take
you directly to Petrovsk where you would
leave the Caspian to go across the mountains.
By one of those boats you would not
have to make a change, and showing your
passport once would be all that was necessary.
Those steamers are not so fine as the<span class="pagenum">[24]</span>
regular passenger boats, but they are comfortable.”</p>

<p>“It seems pretty bad, Sid,” said Raymond,
“for us to run away and leave father here
in prison.”</p>

<p>“I know it does, Ray, but I believe he
would want us to go. If we could help him
by staying I shouldn’t think for a minute
of going, but we should probably only be
a burden to him after he gets out. If we
reach home, perhaps we can help him more
there.”</p>

<p>“I think you should go at once,” said the
clerk; “we can’t tell what may happen before
to-morrow. Already twenty of the waiters
and porters have been taken from the
hotel to serve in the army.”</p>

<p>“There is one thing, Ray,” said Sidney;
“we must first cable mother in New York
what we are going to do. I don’t believe
we had better tell about father, though,
except to say that he has been detained
here.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” said the clerk, “but it is
not allowed to send any private telegrams
out of the country.”</p>

<p>“Could letters be sent out?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>“Oh no; I am sure the German fleet in
the Baltic will intercept all mail.”</p>

<p>“The only thing we can do apparently,”
said Raymond, “is to get out ourselves, if
we <em>can</em> do that.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">THE FLIGHT DOWN THE VOLGA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The boys were not sure that they were
really going to be allowed to leave
Nizhni-Novgorod until the boat had actually
started on its voyage down the river.
Even then they feared that it might be
stopped and they would be taken off and
thrown into a Russian dungeon. When they
found, however, that they were truly leaving
the city where their father was held in
some sort of mysterious restraint, his plight
seemed more dreadful to them than it had
before. The thought that they were deserting
him when he might be in great danger
made them so miserable that they almost
determined to ask to be put ashore and
then to make their way back to the hotel
and stay quietly there until their father was
released or they received a message from
him.</p>

<p>“It makes me feel positively sick,” said
Raymond, “when I think we are leaving
father in an awful Russian prison.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>“It does me, too,” said Sidney, “and I’ve
a good mind to go back.”</p>

<p>“I expect it would be pretty tough,
though, Sid, to stay at the hotel, maybe for
weeks, without hearing from father.”</p>

<p>“And then when he got out perhaps we
shouldn’t be able to leave the city at
all, and mother would think we were all
killed.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said Raymond; “if we reach
some place where we can telegraph, it will
be a great relief to mother.”</p>

<p>“You know, Ray, when father was shut
up in Chihuahua by the rebels he sent us a
message to get home the best way we could,
and said he could depend on us to take care
of ourselves. I believe he would want us to
do the same thing now.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right, Sid, and we are doing
the best thing after all.”</p>

<p>When the matter was finally settled and
the boys had decided that they were doing
the right thing, they felt easier in their
minds and were able to enjoy the strange
sights on the boat. Their cabin, in the bow
on the upper deck, was very comfortable,
and with their soft rugs and pillows they<span class="pagenum">[28]</span>
made up an excellent bed, for on Russian
steamboats and trains bedding is not supplied
without extra charge, so most travelers
take their own.</p>

<p>While the boat was classed as a freight
carrier there were really a great many passengers,
and all were Russian, or people
under Russian rule. Many of the latter
were decidedly Eastern and gave a very
Oriental atmosphere to the scene.</p>

<p>Down on the lower deck, squatting about
on the floor playing various games, were
many brown-clad Tatars, their brown garb
extending even to the heavy brown cloth
head-coverings. Less socially inclined were
gaunt Kalmucks with shaven heads. All
showed their Mongolian origin by their narrow,
slant eyes. Of Mongolian origin also,
but Russian in appearance, were several
Mordvin families going back to their homes
in Simbirsk and Samara. These people, as
well as nearly all the Russians, were preparing
their afternoon potation of tea, made
from pressed tea bricks and hot water which
they obtained from the waiters.</p>

<p>The current of the Volga is very slow and
even, the fall being slight, and as the boat<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>
stopped only at large towns, which on the
river are widely separated, the boys on going
to bed slept as soundly as they would
have done in their own home.</p>

<p>On the right bank of the Volga there are
usually bluffs, sometimes quite high hills,
while much of the country on the left bank
is low and flat. The boys spent the greater
part of the next day lazily gazing out over
the level fields, or inspecting the villages
past which they steamed.</p>

<p>On the third day, August 5, they reached
the large city of Kazan, where the boat
stopped several hours to make a considerable
change of cargo. The boys stationed themselves
near the gangplank to watch the unloading,
for the city is some five miles from
the landing and they thought it too far away
to visit. There was a great deal of animated
talking between the men of the boat and the
men on the wharf, and the boys wondered
if the Russian roustabouts were always so
vivacious. Presently one of the Russian
sailors, whom they had not especially noticed,
addressed them in excellent English.</p>

<p>“I suppose you young gentlemen don’t
understand what these men are saying.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[30]</span></p>

<p>“No,” said Sidney; “we don’t understand
a word.”</p>

<p>“They are talking about the war; it’s
going to be a big fight.”</p>

<p>“Then Germany and Austria will both
fight Russia?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but Russia is backed up by England
and France.”</p>

<p>“Has England joined in the war, too?”</p>

<p>“She joined yesterday; she and France are
Russia’s allies, and they are bound to help
her.”</p>

<p>At that moment the officer in charge of
the unloading called out sharply and the
sailor hurried along with his load. After
the boat had left the wharf at Kazan, the
boys took every opportunity to speak to the
sailor, it was so pleasant to be able to talk
English with some one. They asked information
about the country through which
they were passing, and about the strange
people on the boat. The topic that would
have interested them most was the war, but
the sailor could tell them very little about
that. The man, though a Russian, had
served on English ships, and had been in
many English and American ports, in that<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>
way learning to speak English well. In the
course of the voyage to Astrakhan the boys
picked up many Russian words and phrases
and soon began to feel that they were prepared
to travel anywhere in the empire.</p>

<p>On August 8 the boat tied up to the wharf
at Astrakhan, where the English-speaking
sailor gathered the news and imparted to
the boys the information that President Wilson
had issued a proclamation of neutrality.</p>

<p>The boys soon began to notice that the
people on the boat appeared greatly interested
in them, though at first they had attracted
little attention. After passing out
on to the Caspian not only the captain but
other officers of the boat talked with them
through their friend the sailor, for it happened
that none of the officers spoke English,
as would not have been the case on a
boat in the regular passenger service.</p>

<p>They told the circumstances of their trip
very frankly to the captain, who assured
them that they need not be alarmed about
their father, for he would certainly be released,
though he might be held some days.
All Russian officials, the captain said, would
be extremely busy in the mobilization of<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>
the army, but he was sure that Mr. Porter
would not only eventually be released, but
would probably be helped back to America.
The captain informed the boys that the
Government had wired instructions to the
chiefs of police in all towns where there was
likely to be any foreign travel, that all English,
French, and American travelers, but
especially the latter, should be treated with
the utmost consideration, and should be
assisted whenever possible. Such a message
had been received at Astrakhan.</p>

<p>Sidney asked why Americans should be
treated with greater consideration than the
citizens of other countries, and was told that
it was because the United States was the
only great nation that had remained neutral,
and would probably continue to be neutral
throughout the war.</p>

<p>The boys became quite excited at that
information, and imagined that their father
might even then be at liberty. Sidney declared
that when they arrived at Petrovsk
he would try to reach his father with a telegram,
and if he succeeded they would return
to Nizhni-Novgorod.</p>

<p>The captain dashed their hopes, however,<span class="pagenum">[33]</span>
by telling them that all telegraph lines had
been monopolized by the Government, and
that it would be impossible to send a private
message of any sort. He advised the boys
to continue as they had planned, saying
that they would probably reach home before
their father. He said, moreover, that he
could be of great help to them at Petrovsk.</p>

<p>When they arrived at that port, where
the boys were to leave the boat, the captain
went with them to the chief of police, taking
the sailor along to assist in the conversation.
He explained the state of affairs to the
official, and though no instructions concerning
foreigners had been received at Petrovsk,
probably because that town was so insignificant
a place, the chief of police was finally
convinced that it would be his duty to help
the boys to the extent of his power. The captain
assured him that he had seen the order
sent to Astrakhan, and he was certain the
Petrovsk official would rue the day that he
went contrary to the spirit of those instructions.</p>

<p>The boys had expected to proceed from
Petrovsk by rail to Vladikavkaz, and then
by wagon along the Georgia military road<span class="pagenum">[34]</span>
through the Dariel Pass to Tiflis. They had
been told there was a daily automobile stage
through the pass, but feared that if they
indulged in such luxury, they would not
have money enough to reach home, so decided
to choose the very much slower, but
also very much cheaper, mode of travel.</p>

<p>When the captain learned, however, that
mobilization of the army was being pushed
so vigorously that the Dariel Pass would be
filled constantly with moving troops, he
feared that it would not be safe for the boys
to attempt that route, and advised them to
give it up. He said they would be almost
certain to encounter acts of aggression by
the soldiers, no matter how well disposed
the officers might be. The chief informed
them there was another possible way of
crossing the mountains by trails that led
almost directly south from Petrovsk. But the
mountains through which those trails passed
were extremely rugged and difficult, and the
people who inhabited them were very rough
and sometimes even fierce. That it would be,
in short, a dangerous road, and he doubted
if young boys who were strange to the country
could accomplish a passage. When those<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
drawbacks were explained to the boys, however,
they declared that they were too familiar
with mountains to be scared by anything
of the sort. Indeed, the mountain
route looked very attractive to them, and
they immediately chose it.</p>

<p>The captain thought if the boys were to
pass through so wild a country that they
should have something in the nature of a
passport which they could show, and suggested
that the chief of police should give
them one. As a result, probably accelerated
by a fee of five rubles offered at the
captain’s suggestion, a paper was made out
which stated that Sidney Porter and his
brother Raymond were returning to their
home in the United States on account of the
war in which Russia was engaged, and that
all officials of Russian towns through which
they passed should help them on their way
in obedience to an order received from Petrograd.
Signed by the “Chief of Police of
Petrovsk, Province of Daghestan.”</p>

<p>The sailor read this paper to the boys so
they would know exactly what they were
offering as a passport. When he came to
the end Raymond exclaimed,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>“Where in the world is Petrograd? I
never heard of that place before.”</p>

<p>The man could not inform him, for he had
never heard of the place either; but when
he asked the captain, it was explained that
the Czar had just changed the name of St.
Petersburg to Petrograd, on account of the
German origin of the former name.</p>

<p>“Well, if they feel that way about everything
German,” said Raymond, “I don’t
wonder they arrested father, who could
speak the German language.”</p>

<p>When that matter was arranged, the captain
said that he must return to the boat.
He accordingly bade good-bye to the boys
and embraced them most affectionately.
But he left the sailor with them until they
should have purchased horses and whatever
of an outfit they needed for their mountain
journey. The boys learned from the sailor
that the captain remained in port several
hours longer than he would otherwise have
done, solely to help them get started on their
way.</p>

<p>With the assistance of their friend the
boys purchased two young, spirited horses
and high Tatar saddles. They also bought<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
heavy boots, horsehair cloaks, and saddlebags.
Then they bade good-bye to the sailor
with hearty thanks for his aid, and went to
the inn to get a good rest in preparation for
hard work the next day.</p>

<p>There was a very passable wagon road as
far as the provincial capital, Timour Khan
Shoura, and by getting an early start from
Petrovsk the boys hoped to cover that first
stage of their journey in one day. Accordingly,
they made all final arrangements the
night before so there might be no delay in
the morning. Their traveling-rugs and the
new horsehair cloaks they would tie behind
the saddles, but the pillows which they had
brought with them down the Volga they
could not carry any farther. Those desirable
accessories to a comfortable journey
they accordingly presented to the chief of
police, who had taken so active an interest
in their welfare. The contents of their handbag
they transferred to the saddle-pockets,
and the bag itself they gave to the landlord
of the inn, who also had been very attentive
to their needs and comfort, as far as his limited
resources would allow. The saddlebags
were destined to hold also a limited supply<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
of food, consisting mainly of cheese and the
hard bread of the country.</p>

<p>The boys were on the road in the morning
quite as early as they had desired, and the
new horses proved admirable under the saddle,
though almost too ambitious, requiring
constant watchfulness. The immediately
surrounding country was barren and uninteresting,
but in front the ground rose gradually
until, in the dim distance, it culminated
in the colossal wall of the Caucasus Range,
which they must cross. The principal objects
of interest were the people, chiefly
Tatars, whom they met, or who passed
them, dashing furiously ahead on their wiry
horses of the Steppes.</p>

<p>The day wore on to late afternoon and
the boys judged they were approaching Timour
Khan Shoura, when there appeared a
considerable cavalcade approaching them.
There were a number of loose horses being
driven by half a dozen soldiers under an
officer, who gave a command on reaching
the boys, and the soldiers drew up across the
road, blocking the way.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AN INVOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTION TO THE RUSSIAN ARMY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="dropcap">“We’re going to be robbed by bandits,
Sid!” exclaimed Raymond
when he saw that they were about to be
halted by the men in front of them.</p>

<p>“They can’t be bandits; they must be
soldiers, for they’re in uniform.”</p>

<p>“I guess Russian soldiers would be as bad
as bandits.”</p>

<p>The officer, who, the boys thought, must
be a lieutenant, said something to them in
Russian which of course they did not understand.
Then he made a motion which seemed
to indicate that he wanted them to dismount.
“He is telling us to get off,” said Sidney.
“I’m not going to get off,” declared Raymond.
“Show him your passport.”</p>

<p>Sidney took out the passport and presented
it to the officer, who received and
read it. He then returned it with a polite
bow and with a statement of which the boys
understood only the words meaning “government”<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
and “army.” Still he motioned
for the boys to get off their horses.</p>

<p>“We are Americans,” declared Sidney
to the officer, “and are returning home. The
Russian Government has ordered that all
Americans be helped to leave the country.”
The man replied in his own language,
which was Greek to the boys, and they concluded
that he did not understand them any
better than they did him.</p>

<p>When the officer saw that the boys did
not obey his request he gave an order to his
own men, and one of the soldiers dismounted
and took Sidney’s horse by the bit, motioning
to the boy to get off.</p>

<p>“I tell you what, Ray,” said Sidney, “he’s
going to seize our horses for the Government
to use in the army. See, some of those
loose horses have saddles, they’ve taken
them away from somebody else.”</p>

<p>“He’s not going to have my horse.” And
Raymond dug his heels into the horse and
struck him with the end of the reins. The
spirited animal leaped forward and dashed
to one side of the road to pass the little
group of mounted men and their herd of
horses. The officer gave a sharp order and<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
the men whipped out their pistols. Sidney,
when he saw the threatening movement,
shouted to his brother,&mdash;</p>

<p>“<a id="Ref_41" href="#Ref_41a">Stop, Ray! they’re going to shoot</a>.”</p>

<p>Raymond either did not hear or did not
care, for he struck his horse another blow
and dashed past the obstructing group. Just
as he reached the clear road beyond, the
officer gave another sharp order and the soldiers
fired a volley, all together.</p>

<p>Sidney turned sick and faint, expecting to
see his brother fall from his horse pierced
by half a dozen bullets. Instead, the boy
pulled his horse up with a jerk and took off
his hat, which he examined ruefully.</p>

<p>“They plugged my hat,”&mdash;and he exhibited
a hole through the brim,&mdash;“but if
I had my pistol here I’d show them better
shooting than that.”</p>

<p>“What made you run, Ray?” Sidney remonstrated,
who was trembling with fright;
“I don’t see how you escaped being killed.”
“Pshaw! these fellows couldn’t kill anybody.
I’ll let them see how we shoot in
Texas.”</p>

<p>Raymond jumped off his horse, and going
up to one of the soldiers took hold of the<span class="pagenum">[42]</span>
pistol which the man was still holding in his
hand, at the same time asking him, of course
in English, for the loan of it a few minutes.
The soldier looked inquiringly at his officer,
who made no comment, and the man yielded
the gun.</p>

<p>“Gee! if it isn’t a Colt .38.” And the boy
gazed longingly on the revolver. “That sure
looks like home.”</p>

<p>He held back the hammer and ran the
cylinder around two or three times in wistful
admiration, then he picked up two small
rocks and throwing them into the air he
fired twice in quick succession, shattering
both rocks while they were still high in air.</p>

<p>There were exclamations of wonder from
the soldiers, and the officer said something
which was apparently very complimentary.</p>

<p>“I’ve just got to have that gun, Sid,”&mdash;and
Raymond handled the revolver lovingly,&mdash;“I’m
going to see if I can’t buy it.”</p>

<p>He took twenty rubles from his purse and
holding the gold out to the soldier, pointed
to the revolver. The soldier looked covetously
at the money, but the officer shook
his head, and taking the revolver from Raymond
he showed some letters cut in the barrel,<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
which evidently marked it as belonging
to the Government.</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t dare to sell government
property,” said Sidney, “and anyway we
can’t spare money to buy guns.”</p>

<p>“I suppose we can’t, but I’m thinking
we may wish we had some before we get
through the mountains.”</p>

<p>Raymond turned around to his horse,
which he had left standing when he dismounted
to give his exhibition of shooting,
and was surprised to find that one of the
soldiers had the animal in charge and had
led him over to the bunch.</p>

<p>“Well, they’ve got my horse, all right.
I guess you’ll have to turn yours over too,
Sid.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, but it’s certainly a shame.”</p>

<p>Sidney dismounted and left his horse with
the soldier, who still retained hold of the
bridle. The officer gave an order and two
of the men untied the rolls of blankets and
cloaks from back of the saddles and laid
them on the ground. They then emptied
the saddlebags and placed the contents with
the blankets, but did not remove the bags
themselves. The officer then made out and<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
signed a paper which he gave to Sidney, and
which the boys assumed was a receipt for
the horses.</p>

<p>“You want to take good care of that
paper, Sid,” said Raymond; “it will be a
fine souvenir of the trip, and I expect that’s
about all it will be good for.”</p>

<p>When that was done the soldiers sprang
into their saddles, rounded up all of the
loose horses, including the two which had
so recently belonged to the boys, and galloped
off, the officer giving a courteous salutation
to the boys as they departed.</p>

<p>Sidney and Raymond stood in the road
and looked after their vanishing steeds,
then at the rolls of blankets which lay on
the ground near them. For a few minutes
neither spoke, then Raymond said,&mdash;“We’re
stranded all right this time, Sid.
This beats Lower California.”</p>

<p>“It certainly does, and look at that range
we’ve got to cross.” And Sidney gazed
doubtfully at the far Caucasus, whose northern
heights were white even at that distance.</p>

<p>“I move we go back to Nizhni-Novgorod,”
said Raymond, “and wait for father.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[45]</span></p>

<p>“I don’t believe it would be wise to try
that,” replied Sidney. “By the time we
reached the Volga probably all of the boats
would be taken over by the Government
to carry troops; you remember the captain
said that Russia would mobilize more than
five million men. We might not even be
able to reach Astrakhan. It seems to me the
quicker we get into the mountains the better,
for I imagine they will take soldiers out
of those mountains only as a last resort.”
“Well, it’s going to be dark pretty soon,
and we’d better hustle for this town ahead;
what’s its name?&mdash;Timmy Can Show you.”</p>

<p>Sidney laughed, “I’m sure I hope Timmy
can show us, for we may, like the Missourian,
need to be shown.”</p>

<p>“It’s simply fierce that we’ve got to tote
these things.” And Raymond kicked the
blankets vindictively. “And what are we
going to do with the plunder that came out
of the saddlebags?”</p>

<p>The saddlebags had not contained very
much,&mdash;only the few things that Sidney
had carried in his handbag when they arrived
at Nizhni-Novgorod: a suit of pajamas
for each of them, socks, handkerchiefs,<span class="pagenum">[46]</span>
brush and comb, and their toothbrushes.
Those few things, however, added to their
blankets and cloaks, seemed to Raymond
to be the culminating straw.</p>

<p>“We <em>must</em> hang on to those pajamas,”
continued Raymond; “they’ll be great when
we make our bed toilets on cold nights under
the lee side of a rock.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what they will be great for,
Ray, and that is to put on under our other
clothes when the weather does get cold.”</p>

<p>“Well, I suppose we’d better take them
along,” said Raymond grudgingly; “and we
may as well start.”</p>

<p>The small articles the boys crowded into
their pockets, and each made a long roll of
his blankets and cloak, and carried it over
one shoulder, tying the ends together under
the opposite arm. In that way the bundle
rode well, with very little inconvenience to
the traveler.</p>

<p>When their packs were arranged the boys
started out, and passing through a small
ravine, on emerging into a broader valley,
they were cheered to observe the town which
was the goal of their day’s journey. For the
capital of a large province like Daghestan,<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
Timour Khan Shoura appeared very insignificant,
and when they reached the inn,
they found it to be primitive in the extreme.</p>

<p>Sidney presented their passport to the
landlord, who seemed properly impressed,
though it was plain that he could not read
it. The news of their arrival must have been
spread very promptly, for immediately there
appeared men of all sorts and conditions,
who apparently came solely to view the travelers.
In this crowd was the chief of police,
to whom the passport was turned over, and
who seemed to consider it satisfactory. He
read the paper aloud, and its effect on the
assemblage was great. There was instantly
a Babel of talk, and the boys were familiar
enough with the sound of Russian to know
that a large part of the conversation was in
some other language.</p>

<p>The chief of police asked them a long
string of questions of which they understood
only an occasional word. Sidney assumed,
however, that the official was asking who
they were, where they came from, and
where they were going, so he politely imparted
that information, to Raymond’s great
amusement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<p>“See how wise the old owl looks, Sid, and
I’ll wager he doesn’t understand a word you
say.”</p>

<p>“I hope he doesn’t understand a word
you say. You ought to be careful, Ray; we
may sometime run up against a man who
does understand English.”</p>

<p>“I’d like to meet him now; his voice
would sound good.”</p>

<p>The chief looked at the boys while they
were talking, with a certain amount of suspicion,
as though he thought they might be
plotting something revolutionary, then he
asked another question, of which Sidney
caught the word for “horses.”</p>

<p>“He’s asking if we have no horses,” said
Sidney, and he related how their horses
had been taken, giving it all in English except
the words “government,” “army,” and
“horses,” of which he knew the Russian
equivalents.</p>

<p>The chief appeared to grasp his meaning
without any difficulty, and to be rather
amused by it, for he made a remark to the
surrounding men, who all laughed, and the
talking began afresh.</p>

<p>“They think it’s a great joke,” growled<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
Raymond, “that our horses were stolen.
Maybe they’ll lose some if they don’t look
out.”</p>

<p>“I expect they have lost some already,”
said Sidney, “and that is the reason they
are so interested.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you suppose, Sid, that we can buy
horses here?”</p>

<p>“I doubt it, and I don’t believe we had
better buy more horses even if we can get
them, for we should probably lose them in
the same way.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t see how we are going to cross
that range on foot, Sid. If we only had a
pack-mule now,&mdash;old Tuerto, for instance,&mdash;we
should get along fine.”</p>

<p>“What seems the worst to me,” said Sidney,
“is the time it will take.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that will be bad; but I must say I
don’t hanker after climbing those mountains
on foot, even if we had all the time
there is.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll ask about horses, if I can make
them understand.”</p>

<p>Sidney took some gold out of his pocket
and showed it to the chief, using the Russian
word for “horses” and holding up two fingers.<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
The man shook his head and made a
vigorous statement in which occurred the
familiar Russian words for “government”
and “army.”</p>

<p>“I guess he is saying that the Government
has taken their horses too, but I did a
foolish thing to show that money.”</p>

<p>“There are certainly some villainous faces
in the crowd,” said Raymond. “I think we
had better buy guns.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know but you are right, Ray.
Suppose we buy one gun; I guess we can
spare money for that.”</p>

<p>“We can better spare money for that than
to lose all we have.”</p>

<p>“Then we’d better go out and find one
now, before it gets dark.”</p>

<p>The streets of Timour Khan Shoura were
so narrow and dark that the boys feared
they had waited too long as it was. They
found, however, to their great surprise, that
the bazaars of the town were well stocked
with excellent guns, though their pattern
was somewhat Oriental. They did not know
until afterward that many of the weapons
were manufactured there.</p>

<p>After a short search they purchased a<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
five-shot, .38 caliber revolver with a silver-trimmed
stock. The decorative part of the
gun they would have been willing to omit
in order to save expense, but they could find
none simpler that satisfied Raymond. With
the purchase of a box of cartridges, five of
which went immediately into the cylinder
of the new gun, Raymond said he felt more
like himself.</p>

<p>When they returned to the inn the landlord
indicated that supper was prepared,
and after they had partaken of that they
went to their room, which was on the second
floor. Sidney had been made rather nervous
when he thought about his mistake in showing
money to the crowd of strangers, and
his first care was to assure himself that the
room was secure. He found to his relief that
the window overlooked a clear space with
no other building near. The door was very
solid, but the lock appeared to be more ornamental
than effective.</p>

<p>“I don’t think much of that lock, Ray,”
he said, “and I don’t want to run the risk
of a visit in the night from one of those men.”</p>

<p>“We can soon fix that.” And Raymond
dragged up the only chair, a very heavy oak<span class="pagenum">[52]</span>
one, and braced it under the door handle in
such a way that the door could not be opened
from without. They then swung the window
back for air, as there seemed to be no possibility
of danger from that quarter.</p>

<p>“I’m going to divide my money,” said
Sidney, “and you had better do the same.
We can’t tell what may happen on the road.”
He knotted the greater part of the gold
which he carried in a handkerchief and suspended
it from his neck underneath all of
his clothes.</p>

<p>“Now, if we are held up, unless we are
stripped, the robbers will think the forty
rubles I have left in my purse is all I have.
It’s lucky father insisted on dividing his
money with us. If he hadn’t we should not
have any now to hide from robbers.”</p>

<p>“We shan’t be so likely to be held up,”
said Raymond, “now I have this gun. I
wish I had had a chance to show them the
way I can use it. They would have greater
respect for me.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">NIGHT PROWLERS</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">When the boys had disposed of their
money, most of which they carried
to bed with them, and had barricaded the
door, they went to bed with a feeling of
tolerable security. They were usually both
very sound sleepers, but Sidney had worried
so over his ill-advised exhibition of money
that he slept very lightly that night, and
was constantly rousing to a half-wakened
state.</p>

<p>As he lay in an apprehensive half-slumber
he dreamed that the captain of the river
boat had come to call on them and was trying
to open the door. But for some reason,
which Sidney could not fathom, he could
neither admit the caller nor call out to him
to come in. Suddenly he wakened fully, and
realized that there was some one really at
the door.</p>

<p>He listened intently and could hear a
movement outside, as though a person were
cautiously manipulating the door handle.<span class="pagenum">[54]</span>
He took hold of his brother’s arm and shook
him gently. Raymond started up in bed as
though he had been dreaming too, but Sidney
put his hand over his brother’s mouth
and said “Sh-sh.”</p>

<p>The boys held their breath and listened.
After a few moments there was a slight grating
sound and the fumbling ceased. Then
the door strained against the chair, which,
however, held without sliding on the floor.
Whoever was attempting an entrance had,
without doubt, succeeded in shooting back
the bolt of the lock, and had then tried to
push the door open, but had been balked
by the chair.</p>

<p>After it was discovered that the door was
blocked on the inside, no further noise was
audible. Indeed, what noise there had been
was so slight that it would not have roused
the boys if Sidney had not been nearly awake
and really expecting something of that sort.</p>

<p>They sat up in bed and listened breathlessly
for what seemed a long time, then as
they heard no sound, they lay quietly back
on the pillows. They did not talk, for they
did not want whoever might be lurking outside
to know that they were awake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[55]</span></p>

<p>The door was on Sidney’s side of the bed,
and the window on Raymond’s. From the
bed, as the boys looked out of the window,
they looked directly against the sky, which
was clear and brilliant with stars. The boys
were too thoroughly aroused to go to sleep
again, and lay there thinking about the possible
future dangers of a journey that had
begun so ominously, when they were conscious
that the light from the window was
darkened.</p>

<p>They turned their faces that way and saw
the figure of a man outside the open window.
At first they thought he had climbed up
from below, but in a moment they saw that
he was suspended by a thick rope from above,
and had without doubt let himself down
from the flat roof of the building.</p>

<p>A dark hand grasped the window sill and
the intruder was evidently steadying himself
for the entrance. Raymond seized his
new revolver, which he had placed under
his pillow, raised on his elbow, and, taking
a quick aim, fired. The figure at the window
disappeared, and there was a heavy
thud.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ray!” whispered Sidney, “did you<span class="pagenum">[56]</span>
shoot him? I’m afraid we’ll get into trouble
for that.”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t shoot him; I only cut his
rope and let him down gently.”</p>

<p>“Did you aim for the rope?”</p>

<p>“Sure thing.”</p>

<p>Sidney lay back on the bed and shook
with noiseless laughter. When he was able
to speak he whispered again,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I hope it didn’t jar him much when he
struck the ground. He must have been somewhat
surprised.”</p>

<p>“I have just noticed a thing that has surprised
me,” said Raymond.</p>

<p>“What is that?” asked his brother.</p>

<p>“You don’t see that rope at the window
any more, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Well, after I cut it in two, the rest of it
was drawn up. There was somebody on the
roof who let that fellow down. I believe the
whole caboodle of them were in on this
thing.”</p>

<p>“You did a good job, though, Ray, when
you cut his rope. I imagine they will all be
careful how they come within range of your
gun again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[57]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, unless they think I tried to hit
the man and couldn’t. Never mind, maybe
I’ll fool them next time.”</p>

<p>The boys expected that some one would
come to their room to inquire about the
shooting, and they waited in some apprehension,
but no one came. There was no more
sleep for them, and they lay in bed wide
awake. Presently the dawn flushed the sky
and the light intensified until it was day.
Then the boys got up and dressed, and by
the time that process was concluded the
muezzin’s call to prayers sounded from a
near-by mosque. The faithful were putting
up their petitions in preparation for the
activities of the day. The boys descended
from their room, and were greeted with most
obsequious politeness by the landlord, who
placed before them an appetizing breakfast.</p>

<p>“I wonder if his sleep was disturbed last
night,” Said Raymond. “Isn’t he an innocent
old sinner?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps he didn’t have anything to do
with it,” suggested Sidney.</p>

<p>“Don’t you believe it. If he had been
surprised by the commotion, he would have
tried to find out what it was.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>“I guess maybe shooting, and perhaps
shooting men, too, is so common here that
no one notices it.”</p>

<p>“But we haven’t heard any shooting at
all,” said Raymond, “except what I did.”
“That’s so,” replied Sidney. “Perhaps
they were so attracted by the possibilities
of my purse that they forgot everything
else.”</p>

<p>“They’ll have to make another try for
that purse. I suppose that we’ll have to
pack some grub now, and that’ll be no fun.”
“I guess we’ll have to,” replied Sidney,
“if it’s nothing more than bread and cheese.
I don’t know whether we’ll find a village
very often or not, and we must be prepared
to camp out if necessary.”</p>

<p>After breakfast they went out to a bazaar
and bought two small leather pouches, in
which they placed a little food and the
few small articles they had to carry. The
pouches they slung over their shoulders with
the blanket rolls above. Then they were
ready to begin their tramp, and the undertaking,
when it was close at hand, seemed
so formidable that their courage almost
failed them. It was necessary for Sidney to<span class="pagenum">[59]</span>
bolster up their declining spirits by declaring
again that they would probably not be
able to return to Nizhni-Novgorod even if
they should wish to do so. So they took the
road, or rather the trail, for beyond Timour
Kahn Shoura there was no wagon road, but
only narrow saddle trails that led up into
the high plateaux and ranges of the Caucasus.</p>

<p>That first day their way was through a
succession of narrow, wooded ravines that
were pleasant rather than difficult. The
ascent was gradual and was not difficult at
any time, and there was sufficient shade to
temper the sun’s rays, which, in those southern
valleys, would otherwise have been
scorching.</p>

<p>The boys would have covered the ground
more effectively if they had not been somewhat
nervous as a result of the events of the
preceding night. They fully expected that
the men who had tried to enter their room
at the inn would waylay them somewhere
on the road that day. The country through
which they passed was ideal for such an enterprise,
for there was frequent and abundant
shelter for an ambush. They were,<span class="pagenum">[60]</span>
therefore, constantly on the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui vive</i>, and
examined rather carefully before passing
every spot that seemed favorable for an
attack from robbers. Such vigilance retarded
their speed, and they had a feeling
that they were making very little progress.
The packs, too, though not really heavy,
were burdensome, and toward night made
the boys’ legs, which lately had not been
used to tramping, drag distressingly.</p>

<p>“I guess those fellows at Timmy got
scared last night after all,” remarked Raymond
as the day waned and there had been
no alarm.</p>

<p>“I hope so,” replied Sidney; “a long mountain
tramp is bad enough without having
to watch out all the time for highwaymen.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they would have come out
so far as this, anyway. There were plenty
of good places to hold us up back on the
road. What do you say to making camp?
I’m dead tired.”</p>

<p>“I’m ready to stop. If we don’t get too
tired to-day we’ll travel better to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and the day after, and the day after
that, and so on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>. I guess it will
take us <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i> to get through.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[61]</span></p>

<p>“It won’t do for us to get discouraged at
this stage of the game, Ray.”</p>

<p>“I’m not discouraged; I’m only ready to
quit for the night, and here’s a good place.”</p>

<p>The travelers were following up a ravine
through which a small stream flowed, a
tributary of the larger stream on which Timour
Khan Shoura was situated. At the point
where Raymond proposed to stop, the wall
of the ravine was a rocky bluff that rose
nearly perpendicularly. A short spur jutted
out, forming a small cove which faced up
the ravine and made a well-sheltered spot.
Across to the other side the distance was
perhaps two hundred yards, and midway
flowed the stream. About half a mile farther
up, the walls of the ravine drew together
until a narrow gorge was formed.</p>

<p>The boys unslung their blanket rolls and
threw themselves down on the ground with
exclamations of relief. The disturbance of
the night before, with the nervous strain and
consequent loss of sleep, was a greater tax
on their strength than they had realized at
the time. All day they had been keyed up
by the expectation of trouble, which they
had been braced to meet and defeat. When<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
the necessity for alertness, as they supposed,
was removed, and the tension was relaxed,
they settled down, feeling too languid to
exert themselves further.</p>

<p>Raymond declared that he would rather
loaf than eat, and he didn’t care if he never
ate again if he only got well rested. That
was the way they felt when they stopped, but
a very little rest will suffice to make healthy
boys conscious of gnawing hunger, especially
when they have eaten very little through
the day, as was the case with Sidney and
Raymond.</p>

<p>Soon both of them began to feel a strong
desire to explore the lunch-bags, but they
remembered how dry that lunch was, and
how difficult it would be to eat it without
something to wash it down. Raymond proposed
that they move down to the stream
and eat their supper there where the water
was handy, but Sidney told his brother to
stay where he was and he would take a large
cup with which they had provided themselves
and bring water up.</p>

<p>Raymond lay at his ease on the ground,
lazily watching Sidney as he went down to
the stream and knelt to fill his cup and take<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
a drink before returning to camp. From the
stream, Raymond allowed his gaze to wander
on to the rugged mountains of the opposite
side, and then up the ravine to the narrow
gorge. There his look paused with a
start, for he saw an object moving, which in
a moment he identified as a man. The figure
was coming down the ravine, just below
the gorge. As Raymond looked, the man
dropped to one knee and brought a long
rifle up to a sight down the ravine.</p>

<p>Raymond wondered what the game could
be that was the object of the hunter’s aim.
The gun, apparently, pointed directly down
the ravine, and the boy looked rapidly along
to try to discover the animal. His gaze traveled
down until it encountered his brother
still stooping to fill the cup, and he had seen
no game. Then, as his eye rested on Sidney,
in a flash he realized that his brother
was the game the hunter was stalking. His
heart seemed to leap into his throat, where
it nearly stifled him. Making a supreme
effort he overcame the convulsion of terror
and shouted,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Drop flat, Sid!”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="Page_64" class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A DESPERATE ENCOUNTER</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">When Raymond shouted, Sidney
obeyed instantly without looking
up, and fell flat on his face at the side of the
stream. At the same instant there was a
puff of smoke from the leveled gun, a report,
and a ball whistled just above Sidney’s form.</p>

<p>The man up the ravine sprang to his feet
and dropped the stock of his gun to the
ground. Raymond saw that he was proceeding
to load with powder and ball, and
he shouted to Sidney again,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Come back, Sid, quick, he’s got a muzzle-loader.”</p>

<p>Sidney jumped up and raced for camp,
reaching it before the man had finished
loading his rifle. Raymond took out his pistol
and prepared to shoot, but the distance
to the man who had fired was so great that
he decided to wait, and lowered his gun. As
he did so he saw that the figure up the ravine
was joined by another who came from
out of the gorge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>“Sid,” he said to his brother without taking
his eyes from the men, “they were waylaying
us in the gorge. It’s lucky we were
too tired to go on.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s lucky you stayed here while
I went for water, or that fellow would have
potted me, sure. As it was, I think he didn’t
miss me by more than a foot.”</p>

<p>“He certainly shoots well, and he has a
good rifle. That was a long shot. I wish I
had my rifle here; I don’t know what I shall
be able to do with this revolver.”</p>

<p>The two bandits were in consultation together,
and evidently were examining the
cove that sheltered the boys. After a few
moments of talking one of them crossed to
the farther side of the ravine and walked
down on that side, while the other came
down on the same side where the boys were.
They proceeded slowly and deliberately, but
rather as though that were their customary
mode of walking, for they made no attempt
at concealment.</p>

<p>“They don’t appear to have much respect
for us,” said Sidney; “if they had, they
wouldn’t walk out in the open like that.”</p>

<p>“They think that shot of mine last night<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
was a miss,” said Raymond,&mdash;“that I
tried to hit the man and couldn’t. I presume
they know what kind of a gun I have,
too, and think it’s no good. I wish I knew
how far it will carry. It seems to me it ought
to be good for two hundred yards.”</p>

<p>The cliff back of the boys was so nearly
perpendicular that it would be impossible
for any one to pass along its face, so they
knew they need not fear an attack from
above. They felt pretty sure, indeed, that
there were only the two men who were in
sight in the ravine, who had placed themselves
in ambush for them in the narrow
gorge, and had been disconcerted when the
travelers stopped just before reaching them.
They believed, if they could stand the bandits
off until dark, that they would become
discouraged and return to Timour Khan
Shoura; though the deliberate way in which
the first of the men had attempted to snipe
Sidney did not look as though they would be
easily discouraged.</p>

<p>The wall of the cove was rough and irregular.
In one place a great rock stood out from
the back in such a way as to afford protection
from up the ravine. It was nearly on a<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
line with the jutting spur that formed the
inclosure, so it was protected also from in
front.</p>

<p>The boys made a hasty examination of
their citadel and took refuge at one side of
the big rock at the back. The two bandits
were in plain view, coming leisurely down
the ravine, one on each side. Each man
carried a long gun. They were keeping a
close watch of their quarry, and presently
the one on the near side of the ravine paused
and tested the distance with a shot. The
bullet flattened itself against the rock of the
lower side of the cove, about on a line with
the boys’ heads.</p>

<p>“Gee! Sid,” exclaimed Raymond, “that’s
good shooting. We’ll have to be careful how
we get out of shelter.”</p>

<p>“I never saw anything so cold-blooded,”
said Sidney. “They come down just as
deliberately as though they were shooting
rabbits.”</p>

<p>The man who had fired was still reloading
his gun, and Raymond jumped out from
behind the rock to a place where he was still
protected by the jutting spur from the man
across the ravine, and announced,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[68]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going to fire at him before he finishes
loading, but I’ll shoot into the ground
about two thirds of the way out, so he’ll
think my gun won’t carry any farther.”</p>

<p>Raymond fired and his bullet threw up
the dirt far short of the advancing bandit.
They imagined that they could see a smile
of derision on the man’s face. At that moment
the other man fired from across the
ravine, and again the boys were shown that
only a position behind the rocks would protect
them from such expert shooting.</p>

<p>Steadily the two men came down the ravine,
firing occasionally. As the boys were
safe hidden behind the rocks, and could not
be reached by a bullet from either direction,
they concluded that the bandits were firing
merely to prevent a sally on their part.
Why they should do that, however, the
boys could not understand, for it would
have seemed to be better to encourage them
to expose themselves; especially as there
seemed to be no fear of the one small gun in
the boys’ possession.</p>

<p>Every shot, apparently, was placed with
precision, for every one entered on a line
that was nearest to the boys’ shelter. <em>Spat!<span class="pagenum normalfont">[69]</span>
spat!</em> they came, first from one side and then
from the other. Not very rapidly, for there
was always necessarily a pause for reloading.</p>

<p>Steadily the bandits advanced, until they
were less than two hundred yards from the
cove. And they were still perfectly indifferent
to any danger they might be in from
Raymond’s gun. Such a steady, relentless
advance began to fill the boys with panic.
They felt as though an inexorable fate were
closing in on them.</p>

<p>“I can’t stand this much longer, Sid.”
And Raymond’s face was pale with the nervous
strain. “I feel as though I were being
killed by inches.”</p>

<p>“Do you think your pistol would reach
them now?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it, but I am not sure that I
have the nerve to stand out and shoot
them.”</p>

<p>“I believe our only chance for salvation is
to kill those men, Ray. I thought at first
we might frighten them, but they’re not the
kind to be frightened. I would be willing to
take the responsibility of shooting them, but
I can’t shoot so close as you can, and I might
miss, and a miss would be the end of us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[70]</span></p>

<p>“I’m not afraid of missing,” said Raymond,
“but it makes me sick to think of
potting them like rats.”</p>

<p>Still the advance continued, with an occasional
shot. By that time the men were so
close that their features could be plainly
distinguished, and the boys were surprised to
see that the bandits were white as themselves.
The mountain tribes of Central
Daghestan, the Lesghians, are a conglomerate
race. There are many tribes, of many
different origins, and some of them have
very fair skin.</p>

<p>“If I wait much longer I shan’t be able
to shoot at all. I’m beginning to shake now.
If only they weren’t white! It wouldn’t
be half so bad if they were black. As soon
as the man on this side shoots again I’m
going to wing them.” And Raymond examined
his revolver carefully, bringing the
hammer back to full cock.</p>

<p>“Do you mean you will only disable
them? Do you think that would be wise?”

“No; I’ll shoot to kill.” And there was
a look of fixed determination on Raymond’s
face, which was whiter than before.</p>

<p>In a moment a bullet from the bandit on<span class="pagenum">[71]</span>
their side spattered the rocks. Raymond
stepped quickly out from the shelter with
his revolver pointing over his right shoulder
as he held it high before him. Bringing the
gun forward into position with the lightning
sureness of one accustomed to shooting a
heavy pistol, the instant it reached a level
before his eyes he fired, without appearing to
take any aim. The man in the distance turned
half around and pitched down to one side.</p>

<p>Not waiting to note the effect of his shot,
Raymond stepped to the left, beyond the
projecting spur of rock which formed the
cove, bringing himself in range of the other
bandit, who was raising his gun into position.
The boy threw his revolver up and
brought it down to a level with the same
lightning precision, and fired. The man in
front also fired, but a thought too late, and
his bullet went wild. He dropped his gun
and lunged forward, falling on his face.</p>

<p>Raymond had moved with absolute certainty
and incredible quickness, but now
that the dreadful business was concluded,
his pistol hand fell nervelessly to his side and
he leaned, trembling, against the wall of the
cove.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[72]</span></p>

<p>“Don’t feel like that about it, Ray.” And
Sidney placed his hand affectionately on his
brother’s shoulder. “There was no other
way, but I’m sorry you had to do it instead
of me.”</p>

<p>“When we had fights with the Mexicans
last winter there was always the excitement
of a battle that made it seem inevitable, but
this was so cold-blooded that it really got
my nerve.”</p>

<p>“Shall we go out and look at those men?”
asked Sidney. “They may be only stunned.”

“You needn’t worry about that. I’m
sure they’re dead, but I don’t think I want
to see them. How about taking their guns,
though?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we ought to take anything
that belonged to them; then when they are
found, no one can accuse us of robbery.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you are right,” said Raymond,
“but those guns might come in mighty
handy.”</p>

<p>“I think we’d better get something to
eat,” said Sidney, “then we’ll both feel better.
You wait here and I’ll go down and
bring up some water.”</p>

<p>When Sidney returned with the water,<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
Raymond had taken out the food and was
waiting for his brother to join in the lunch.</p>

<p>“Gee! Sid,” he said, “think what has happened
since you went after water the first
time. I was scared stiff when I looked up
the ravine and saw that man draw a bead
on you. I thought at first he was shooting
game of some kind, and I looked along the
ravine to see if I could see what it was.
Then when I saw you kneeling to get a drink,
in a flash I knew it was you he was after.”</p>

<p>“It was a close call for me. And if you
were not a dead sure shot we should be done
up by now. You know Ramon used to boast
that you were the best shot in Mexico, and
I guess there aren’t many better anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shook so I was afraid I couldn’t
do a thing. But just as soon as I stepped
out to shoot I was perfectly steady, and then
when it was all over I was weak as a cat.”</p>

<p>The boys had thought they were pretty
tired when they stopped to make camp, and
they had been under such a strain since that
when relaxation came they were simply exhausted.
They had barely energy sufficient
to roll up in their blankets. Fortunately,
the night was warm and it made little difference<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
whether they were really covered.
Their minds were relieved of all anxiety of
a possible attack, for they believed that the
two men who were lying so still out in the
ravine were the only ones whom they had
had to fear. Consequently, they were no
more than stretched out on the ground when
both were sleeping profoundly.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A LESGHIAN JAIL</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">It was broad day, though the sun had not
climbed high enough to look down into
the ravine, when the boys woke. Sidney was
the first to rouse, and he lay quietly gazing
up into the sky, which, from that position,
looked like the bluest sea, with floating
masses of fleecy wool. He reviewed the exciting
events of the previous day and night,
and wondered what might still be in store for
them. He could not believe, however, that
they would encounter again such bloodthirsty
bandits as the two men who had
attacked them. They had been given to
understand that the mountaineers of the
Caucasus, while often fierce and wild, were
usually honorable and hospitable. Their
first experience of the people of Daghestan
had justified such a report, for the men with
whom they had had dealings at Petrovsk
had been attentive and considerate. Sidney
thought that might possibly have been due<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
to the fact that those men were probably
really Russian.</p>

<p>Presently Raymond woke, and with characteristic
impetuosity jumped up the moment
his eyes were open.</p>

<p>“Are you awake, Sid? I tell you I’m glad
we are both here safe. It seems now as
though that affair of yesterday couldn’t be
true, but I suppose we’d find those fellows
lying out there if we went to look.”</p>

<p>“I’m worrying a little, Ray, about the
chance of our getting into trouble over that.
If we should be arrested for killing those
men, we don’t know a word of the language
here, and it might be impossible for us to
show that we did it in self-defense.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t these people speak a civilized
language instead of such a barbaric jargon!
If they only knew Spanish, now, that would
do all right.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it would do all right for us,” said
Sidney, laughing, “but it might not for the
next travelers.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there are any next travelers
here; we are the only ones.”</p>

<p>The boys ate a dry breakfast, slung
their blanket rolls over their shoulders, and<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
took up their long tramp. Their way led
past the first bandit who had fallen a victim
to Raymond’s skill. The man, apparently,
did not move after he fell. His hands
still grasped a long-barreled, silver-trimmed
rifle, and from a cord hung an ornately decorated
dagger. His head was covered with a
conical, black, lamb’s wool cap, and he was
clothed in a coat which was so long that it
reached nearly to his ankles. On either side
of the front of his coat were fastened silver
cartridge cases. The whole effect of the
man’s equipment was that of comfortable
affluence.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Sidney, as they regarded
the prostrate form, “that if he had
gone to the war with Germany he might
have met the same fate.”</p>

<p>“He certainly would have made a fine
soldier, but I guess he had a better business.
Brigandage must be profitable.”</p>

<p>“I can’t help feeling uneasy, Ray,” said
Sidney as they went on, “about what will
happen when those men are found.”</p>

<p>“I’m not going to worry, Sid. As you
said, there was nothing else we could do.”</p>

<p>The boys soon reached the gorge, where<span class="pagenum">[78]</span>
the bandits had, probably, planned to waylay
them. It was an ideal spot for such an
enterprise. The opening was narrow, and
the cliffs on either side were ragged and
broken, affording the best possible place for
concealment. The boys were quite sure if
they had gone on the night before that they
would not then be traveling.</p>

<p>A short distance above the entrance to the
gorge they came upon two horses tied with
ropes. The animals were fully accoutered,
carrying bridles and saddles. They had
evidently been tied there many hours, for
they had restlessly tramped the ground
within the length of their tethers, and they
whinnied entreatingly when they saw the
boys.</p>

<p>“Gee, Sid,” exclaimed Raymond when
he saw the animals, “those horses must have
belonged to the bandits, and they’re just
the ticket for us.”</p>

<p>“It would never in this world do for us to
take them, Ray. That would make it look
as though we had killed the men for their
horses.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean you’re going to leave
them here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[79]</span></p>

<p>“That’s exactly what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Why, that would be outrageous, Sid,
when we need horses so badly, and we are
sure the owners were those dead men.”</p>

<p>“Nothing under Heaven could make me
touch those horses, Ray.”</p>

<p>“Well, I guess you’re right, Sid, you always
are. But at any rate, we’ll give them
some water, they must be awfully dry.”</p>

<p>“I would like to water them, Ray, but I
think it wouldn’t be safe to do even that.
I would rather leave them exactly as they
are. It is almost certain that some one will
pass soon and find them.”</p>

<p>“Gee, you <em>are</em> cautious, Sid. Well, if
we’ve got to hoof it, we may as well keep
going.” And Raymond rather grumpily continued
the march.</p>

<p>The gorge proved to be a short one, and
the boys soon came out into a valley, on the
farther side of which, climbing up the mountain
slope, they saw a village. They were
uncertain whether to be pleased or apprehensive
at the prospect of encountering people.
If they could get into the high mountains
before the bodies which they had left
in the ravine were discovered, it might be<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
that they would not be followed and would
not be caused any trouble by their successful
effort to protect their own lives. On the
other hand, they had very little food, and
they were not sure that they would be able
to replenish their supply after they had once
really entered the mountains.</p>

<p>There seemed, however, to be no way of
avoiding the town, if they had wished to do
so. The trail led directly to it, and as the
country rose abruptly beyond, they knew
that the village, in all probability, must be
at the foot of the only road that penetrated
the range.</p>

<p>When they were halfway across the valley,
two wild-looking horsemen emerged
from the gorge and dashed past them.</p>

<p>“Those fellows act as though they were
scared by what they saw in the ravine,” remarked
Raymond as he watched the riders
enter the village.</p>

<p>“More likely,” said Sidney, “they are
hurrying to report what they found, and
warn officers to take us.”</p>

<p>The boys followed slowly and reluctantly.
They would have been very much happier
if they could have skipped that first village,<span class="pagenum">[81]</span>
for the more they reflected on the possibilities
before them, the more uneasy they felt.
They wondered if they had made a supreme
effort to get out of Russia only to land in a
mountain jail. And they thought, if that
should be the outcome of their adventure,
that their father would be infinitely better
off in a civilized city like Nizhni-Novgorod,
even if he had not yet recovered his liberty.</p>

<p>They entered the village and passed along
the narrow, crooked street, looking for a
bazaar where food might be purchased.
They thought they would buy the very first
eatables they saw, and then hurry out of
town and on into the mountains. They were
not, however, to be allowed to do that. They
had proceeded but a short distance in their
search for supplies when they were met by
two men who were armed with the customary
rifles and swords. The men, who somehow
gave the impression of being officials,
placed themselves one on each side of the
boys, and taking hold of their arms hurried
them along with a brief statement in a
strange language that was plainly not Russian.</p>

<p>Sidney began a remonstrance and a request<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
to know why they were seized in that
way, but their captors paid not the least
attention to what he said. He wished to
present his passport to one of the men, but
they were forced along so precipitately that
he could not get the paper out of his pocket.
Indeed, they were nearly out of breath when
they were pulled up before a small stone
building, pushed through a doorway, and
the door slammed and locked behind them.</p>

<p>It was so dark in the room where the boys
were thrown, the only light coming through
one small window, that at first they were
unable to distinguish anything. Moreover,
they were dazed by the sudden and violent
change in their condition. Presently, however,
as their eyes became accustomed to the
dim light, they were able to see into what
sort of quarters they had been thrust.</p>

<p>The room in which they found themselves
was absolutely bare except that in one corner
were three or four planks raised a little above
the floor, evidently designed for a bed. At
least the room was bare of furniture, but it
was indescribably filthy, and the boys gradually
became aware that the filth which
littered the floor and the plank bed was<span class="pagenum">[83]</span>
swarming with vermin. The boys gazed at
each other, at first too stunned and shocked
for expression, then indignation possessed
Raymond.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” he said, “that we ought to
have expected this. Russia is not civilized,
anyway, and we are served right for visiting
such a God-forsaken country.”</p>

<p>“But you must remember,” said Sidney,
“that appearances are very much against
us. They have no doubt found the bandits,
and assume, quite reasonably, I must admit,
that we killed them. I really don’t wonder
that they arrested us.”</p>

<p>“Well, they might have done it in a civilized
way.”</p>

<p>“That man must have been explaining
why they arrested us, but we couldn’t understand
him, which was not his fault.”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, Sid, are you excusing
these ruffians?”</p>

<p>“No, but I am trying to imagine what I
should think in their place.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be fully occupied in what you
think of <em>this</em> place,” said Raymond with
sarcastic emphasis. “Do you suppose they’ll
keep us here to-night? If they do, we’ll<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
have to sleep standing. I don’t want to put
my blankets down on <em>that</em> bed, if it is a bed.”</p>

<p>The boys still had their blankets slung
over their shoulders. Rather strangely, as
it seemed to them now that they had time
to think it over, none of their belongings
had been taken from them. Even Raymond’s
revolver was still in his possession.</p>

<p>“It isn’t a very attractive bed, that’s a
fact,” said Sidney.</p>

<p>“I’d like to get rid of my load, too.” And
Raymond looked around to see if by any
chance there was a spot that was passably
clean. There was no comfort to be found in
examining the floor, or the plank bed, and
he turned his attention to the walls. The
house was built of rough stone, and the walls
were not finished in any way on the inside.
But rough as the walls were, there was no
projection on which anything might be laid
or from which it might be suspended. The
window, which was about two feet square
and was some five feet above the floor, was
set with iron bars, but contained no glass.
Raymond examined that, and said to his
brother:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We can hang our things to these bars,<span class="pagenum">[85]</span>
Sid, if they are strong enough to hold anything,
but they are nearly rusted through.
Sid!” he continued in a tone of excitement,
“I believe we can easily break these bars
out.” And he grasped one to test it.</p>

<p>“Hold on, Ray,” cried his brother; “don’t
touch them now. We couldn’t get out until
after dark, and if they found we had broken
a bar, they would put us somewhere else.”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” assented Raymond, “but
I’m sure we can break them out. They’re
not so smart, after all, with their filthy old
jail.”</p>

<p>“I expect if we do get out,” said Sidney,
“that we’ll have a tough time in finding our
way out of this town in the dark. My vague
recollection of the place is that the streets
are a regular Chinese puzzle.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Raymond, “we’ll be outside
of this wretched place, anyway, and I’ll take
my chances then on making a getaway.”</p>

<p>They proceeded to suspend their blanket
rolls and knapsacks from the bars, and had
no more than disposed of their packs in that
way when the door was thrown open and an
official with two attendants entered.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AN ESCAPE</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">The official who entered the jail gave
instructions to his two subordinates
and they proceeded to search the boys, but
Sidney stepped back and raised his hand in
appeal.</p>

<p>“Wait,” he said, “I have a passport that
will explain who we are.”</p>

<p>He took the paper out from his breast
pocket and presented it to the official, who
regarded it curiously, but immediately returned
it with a short comment which the
boys, of course, could not understand.</p>

<p>“I’ll bet he can’t read Russian,” said
Raymond.</p>

<p>“That’s so,” said one of the men in broken
English, “he not speak Russian, only Lesghian.”</p>

<p>“Hello!” exclaimed Raymond in surprise,
“where did you learn English?”</p>

<p>“I live New York.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you stay there?”</p>

<p>“I come home.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be jiggered! you leave New
York to come back to such a place as
this?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I leave New York; I come back
home.”</p>

<p>“Do you read Russian?” asked Sidney.</p>

<p>“No, not read Russian.”</p>

<p>“Who is this officer?”</p>

<p>“He chief polis.”</p>

<p>“Tell him,” said Sidney, “that I have a
passport which says that we are American
citizens returning to America, and that all
Russian officials are commanded by the
Government to help us.”</p>

<p>The man had a short conference with his
superior and then turned to Sidney.</p>

<p>“He says you kill two men.”</p>

<p>“But they attacked us,” said Sidney;
“we only defended ourselves. We did not
take anything that belonged to them. We
left their guns and horses and everything.
Tell him that.”</p>

<p>There was another conference and the
man turned again to Sidney.</p>

<p>“He says you have trial, maybe next
week.”</p>

<p>“Holy smoke!” exclaimed Raymond in<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>
horror, “they wouldn’t keep us in this
filthy place till next week?”</p>

<p>“Maybe next week, maybe longer.”</p>

<p>The chief had waited patiently, smiling
blandly, but he apparently thought the conversation
had lasted long enough, for he gave
a command to his deputies, and the man repeated:&mdash;</p>

<p>“He says we search you now.”</p>

<p>The task they had before them must have
been an unaccustomed one, for they were
particularly awkward about it, and not at
all thorough. The boys’ purses they found
at once, and the chief himself took immediate
charge of them, but Raymond’s revolver
was the only other article which they seemed
to think it worth while to remove. The
money which the boys carried concealed
beneath their clothes was not discovered,
and the only attention they gave to the blankets
was to make joking remarks and laugh
when the rolls were noticed hanging from
the window bars. The boys could imagine
that the men were commenting on the comfortable
night they would pass if they attempted
to sleep on their suspended beds.
When the search was concluded, the chief<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
and his assistants left the room without
further word.</p>

<p>“I wish I’d used my revolver before they
took it,” said Raymond as the door closed
and the bolt slid into place. “I could easily
have shot all three.”</p>

<p>“And that would have been a specially
foolish thing to do,” said Sidney.</p>

<p>“Well, it would have been specially satisfactory,
if it was foolish.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad, though,” said Sidney, “that
we didn’t take any such desperate step as
that. It is much better to wait till night and
see if we can’t get out through the window,
as I believe we can.”</p>

<p>“Those fellows are so stupid,” said Raymond,
“that I don’t believe they would
know enough to stop us if they saw us climbing
out of the window. Think of their not
finding the rest of our money! It’s lucky
for us they didn’t.”</p>

<p>The day wore on past noon, and the boys
took a lunch from their knapsacks. Though
the lunch was extremely simple, consisting
mainly of dry bread, they were able to occupy
considerable time in disposing of it,
for very careful mastication was necessary<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
in order to swallow the food without water,
of which there was none. Aside from that
diversion there was nothing whatever for
them to do while they waited the arrival of
night.</p>

<p>The window looked out against a blank
wall, only a few feet away, and gave them
no view of the village. The door was so extremely
thick that it allowed no sound to
penetrate. Though it opened on the street,
the boys could distinguish no noise of passing
feet, and what appeared strange to them
was that the only noise they heard seemed
to come from the roof.</p>

<p>When the boys were put into the jail in
the morning, the whole affair of their arrest
and imprisonment had been so hasty and so
bewildering that they had not taken note
of the fact that the jail was situated against
the mountain-side. Above the jail other
buildings ran up the steep slope, and the
roofs of the lower lines of buildings formed
front yards for the next line of buildings
above, and so on to the top. So the roof
of the jail no doubt was occupied, possibly
as a stable for the horse that belonged to the
family above. On that plan are built many of<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>
the mountain villages of Daghestan, very like
the villages of our own Pueblo Indians.</p>

<p>Toward night the English-speaking policeman
opened the door and brought in water
and black bread, closing the door after him.
The drink, though in a repulsive-looking
receptacle, was most welcome to the boys.</p>

<p>“You like it here?” asked the man, with
a twinkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>“No, it’s filthy,” replied Raymond.</p>

<p>“Yes, pretty dirty, not like New York
jail.”</p>

<p>“Do you know a New York jail?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know New York jail.”</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked Sidney.</p>

<p>“Aleskandir,” replied the man.</p>

<p>“Is there another village near here?”</p>

<p>“No, long way next village.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Sidney, “I guess we’ll have
to go back to Timour Khan Shoura.”</p>

<p>“You want me let you out?” asked the
man. “You give me twenty rubles, I let
you out after dark.”</p>

<p>“How can I give you twenty rubles?”
asked Sidney. “You took our money away,
the chief of police has it.”</p>

<p>“I think you got more money,” said the<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>
man with a cunning look. “You have lump
under clothes.” And he tapped his breast
significantly.</p>

<p>The boys were very much startled by the
revelation that the policeman knew they
had more money. Raymond, though excited
by the prospect of an easy release, fortunately
had presence of mind to remain
quiet and leave the matter in Sidney’s hands,
realizing that one could manage it better
than two.</p>

<p>Sidney could not be sure that the man
before them was the only one who knew
that all of their money had not been taken
away. It was possible that the chief of police
was just as well informed, and there was
a prearranged plan to get the boys to try to
escape. Perhaps, Sidney thought, there was
a custom among the Lesghians similar to the
Mexican “Ley de fuga,” in plain English,
law of flight, which encouraged a prisoner to
escape and then shot him in the act. Possibly
any money taken from a prisoner who
was killed in that way would not be reported
by the chief of police, and that would be
an inducement for the official to encourage
such attempted escapes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[93]</span></p>

<p>Sidney ran the matter over in his mind so
rapidly that only a few moments were consumed
while the man was waiting an answer
to his proposal. But he did not dare trust
the fellow, for he realized that if they were
once outside the jail there would be nothing
to prevent the man from taking whatever
money they had, perhaps putting them out
of the way to accomplish it. So he determined
to deny that he had any money left,
and said accordingly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“I have no money to pay you.”</p>

<p>“You be sorry,” said the man with an
ugly look. “You get shot.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” asked Sidney.</p>

<p>“You kill two men, you both get shot.”
And he opened the door and went out, locking
it behind him.</p>

<p>“What made you do that, Sid?” asked
Raymond when they were alone. “Why
didn’t you give him the bribe he wanted?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think he’s to be trusted.”</p>

<p>“But he is sure we have the money.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is, and that’s just the trouble.
If he once got us out of here he would probably
kill us and take it all.”</p>

<p>“Well, it doesn’t matter so much after<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>
all,” said Raymond, “for I’m sure we can
get out through the window.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” suggested Sidney, “if that fellow
isn’t waiting outside to receive us. He may
know the window bars are rotten and thinks
we’ll try that way.”</p>

<p>“We’ll give him a run for his money, anyway.
If I <em>only</em> had that revolver I’d give
him something besides a run. I hate to
start up through the mountains without any
gun, Sid. Did you notice if that man had
one?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he had a long revolver in his belt,
I should think a .38.”</p>

<p>“I almost wish he’d be waiting outside,
then, and I’d make a try for it. Those boneheads
didn’t take our cartridges, so all we
lack is a gun.”</p>

<p>The boys were very much amused by the
inefficient search the policemen had conducted.
Their knapsacks hung with the
blanket rolls from the window bars in plain
view, but had not been examined at all. The
sacks contained, besides a few small articles
of clothing and a little food, all of Raymond’s
ammunition. If they could only obtain
a gun of the same caliber, they would<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
still be well fortified. Sidney admonished
his brother, however, to take no rash chances,
at any time, in an attempt to procure arms.</p>

<p>The black bread which the policeman had
brought to them was not at all inviting in
its appearance,&mdash;indeed it was fairly repulsive,&mdash;but
they decided to keep it, for
if they were to succeed in escaping from the
town in the night, they would, of course, have
no chance to buy food. So the bread was
stowed away in the knapsacks with the small
supply already there.</p>

<p>The boys, while it was still light, carefully
inspected the window bars so that they would
know just what to do in the dark. They did
not place their hands on them, for they did
not wish anybody who might be watching
outside to observe that the bars were being
examined. They found that the rains which
had rusted the bars had, of course, run downward,
so that the irons, while nearly rusted
through at the lower ends, were still very
solid at the top. They believed that they
would be able to break the bars loose at the
bottom, and then to bend them up, in that
way making an opening of sufficient size to
admit their bodies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>After their plan of action was arranged,
the boys waited, with as much patience as
possible, for the closing-down of night. They
could not plan beyond climbing out of the
window, for their further action would depend
on whether there were any persons
abroad in the streets. They hoped that the
sky would be clear, so that they would be
able to locate the mountains, and not make
a mistake in direction.</p>

<p>Finally it became dark, and very dark
it was, indeed, inside the jail. But they
waited what seemed to them a long time
after that, to make it probable that all
stragglers would have returned home. When
they were sure that night was well advanced,
they began operations on the window bars,
tentatively at first, to see what resistance
they would be obliged to overcome.</p>

<p>“Let me hang all this plunder over your
shoulders, Ray, so as to get it out of the
way. I don’t want to put it on the dirty
floor.” And Sidney suited the action to the
word and disposed of the blanket rolls and
knapsacks by turning his brother into a
pack-animal.</p>

<p>Then he selected the bar which seemed<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
to be thinnest at the lower end, and began
to give it quick, sharp jerks, first one way
and then the other. At first that assault
made very little impression, then the bar
began to yield a trifle. Suddenly, with almost
no warning, when Sidney gave an
especially strenuous pull, the iron snapped
in two at the bottom, the upper end dropped
out of the hole where it had rested in the
masonwork, and the bar fell clattering to
the floor.</p>

<p>The boys stood rigid with their hearts in
their throats. The noise had echoed back
from the walls of the empty room until they
were sure it must have roused the whole
town. They waited, hardly daring to breath,
listening for the sound of running feet, and
then for the opening of the door and the entrance
of guards. Why <em>hadn’t</em> he bribed that
man to let them out! Sidney thought, bitterly.
That would have been a chance, at
least, and after such an alarm, of course,
there would be no chance at all.</p>

<p>Outside, however, the silence was not
broken, but continued as profound as before.
The occasional barking of a dog only
served to emphasize the lack of other sound.<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
As the boys waited in tense suspense, they
could hardly credit their ears which told
them that the terrific clatter of the falling
bar had roused no corresponding commotion
outside. After they had stood absolutely
quiet so long that the impulse to shout
was almost uncontrollable, they were convinced
that no harm had been done, and
Raymond whispered to his brother,&mdash;</p>

<p>“This must be where the Seven Sleepers
live, Sid. We’ll get away all right and don’t
you forget it.”</p>

<p>“The sounder they sleep the better,” replied
Sidney.</p>

<p>With the loose iron to use as a lever the
other two window bars were quickly broken
at the bottom and bent up, for they did not
come loose at the top as the first one had
done. Then the boys arranged their plans
carefully so that there might be no slip.</p>

<p>“We’ll each sling a knapsack on,” said
Sidney. “We can get out with them on all
right, and that will be the best way to carry
them. Then I’ll climb out and you pass me
the beds and come yourself.”</p>

<p>That was easily accomplished; Sidney
climbed out without mishap, and received<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
the blanket rolls which Raymond passed
him. Then Raymond prepared to follow.
The window was large enough so that he
climbed up into it, and drawing his legs up
turned around and proceeded to drop down
on the outside, feet first. But when he let
himself down on the outside of the wall, his
trousers caught on the stub of one of the
bars that had broken just above the window
sill. For a moment he was suspended in the
air, then the cloth gave way with a rip and
he fell with a thud in a heap on the ground.</p>

<p>Sidney stood waiting for his brother with
the blanket rolls in his hands. Though it
was very dark, it had been so much darker
inside the building that he could distinguish
objects very well. He saw that they were in
a sort of an alley, only a few feet wide, between
the jail and the next building. Toward
the front of the jail it opened out into
a wider space which Sidney knew must be a
street. The other way it melted into indistinguishable
blackness.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ray!” exclaimed Sidney when his
brother came tumbling down, “I guess we’ll
wake the Seven Sleepers after all.”</p>

<p>As Raymond was gathering himself up<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
from the ground a man dashed around the
front of the jail toward them.</p>

<p>“Come this way, Ray, I’ve got all the
plunder, we can get away from him,” cried
Sidney, and he ran in the opposite direction,
followed by his brother.</p>

<p><span id="Page_101" class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A CHASE</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">The boys ran up the alley, Sidney leading
with both the blanket rolls, and
Raymond following a short distance behind.
Close after them came the man who had
rushed around the corner of the jail, and who
was evidently doing his best to overtake
them.</p>

<p>The boys found that the alley climbed up
a steep slope, and they stumbled up the ascent
with breathless haste. The man who
pursued them was shorter, older, and less
agile, so, although he was carrying nothing,
and Sidney, at least, was well loaded, the
boys managed to keep ahead. Raymond,
however, stepped on a loose stone and floundered
along, barely saving himself, with his
hands on the rising ground, from a complete
fall. He felt, rather than saw, that their
pursuer was close upon him. He made up
his mind that if it came to a grapple he would
call out to Sidney for help, and run the risk
of bringing others whom they would not<span class="pagenum">[102]</span>
want. But with a supreme effort he recovered
his balance in time to save himself from
the grasp of the man behind.</p>

<p>Up, up, they struggled until their pounding
hearts and panting lungs nearly suffocated
them. The walls continued along the
sides with no change that was perceptible
in the darkness, and the boys wondered on
what plan the village could be constructed.</p>

<p>At last Sidney came to the end of the
alley and found there was an opening, a similar
narrow passageway, to the left. Around
that corner the alley extended on a level, and
having made the turn, Sidney’s road was
much easier. He soon came to a blind wall
across the passage, and groping along its
face, in the corner between that wall and the
wall of the alley, he felt a ladder.</p>

<p>Sidney hesitated for a moment, wondering
where the ladder could lead, but as he
could find no opening in the wall, and as he
could not well turn back, he went up it.
After climbing eight or ten feet he stepped
over the top of the ladder to a level surface
that was apparently a dozen feet or so wide.
At the left there seemed to be only space,
but on the right rose a wall in which dimly<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
showed an opening. He stood and listened.
From down in the alley came the noise of
Raymond and his pursuer running. Then
for a moment there was a pause in the sound,
followed by a heavy thud, and in another
moment the sound of a blow.</p>

<p>Sidney strained his eyes to see into the
gloom below, to discover, if possible, what
was happening there. Failing in that he
threw his blankets down on the ground and
grasped the ladder to descend, fearing that
harm had come to his brother. As he did
so, one person instead of two came running
along the darkness below, and the figure
blundered into the wall at the end.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Ray?” Sidney whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply from below.</p>

<p>“There is a ladder, a little to your left,”
he directed.</p>

<p>When Raymond had reached the angle of
the alley, the man behind was so close that
he believed he would be overtaken, especially
as his breath, from the violent running
uphill, was becoming very short. So he
decided to resort to a trick. After running
for a few feet along the level floor of the alley
beyond the turn, he dropped to one knee<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
and turned to face his pursuer, crouching
closely to the ground. The fellow came on at
full tilt and Raymond grasped him by one
leg and rose with his burden. The impetus
the man had acquired in running sent him
hurtling through the air and he crashed,
head first, against the wall. Stunned by the
blow, he fell in a huddled heap.</p>

<p>Instead of running on after Sidney, as
Raymond’s first impulse had been when his
pursuer was placed <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors de combat</i>, with a
sudden thought he stopped to examine his
fallen antagonist. Something in the aspect
of the man as he was flying over Raymond’s
head had seemed familiar. He turned the
form over to bring the face upward and,
stooping, peered closely. It was just as he
had suddenly suspected, the man was the
English-speaking policeman. That meant
that he probably had a revolver stuck in his
belt, and Raymond immediately fumbled
under the man’s coat. Pulling out the gun
which he felt there, an instant’s examination,
even in the dark, convinced him that
it was indeed a .38 caliber. He wanted to
whoop for joy that he once more had a
serviceable weapon to fit the ammunition<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
which they still possessed. It did not occur
to him for a moment that in appropriating
the revolver he was doing practically
the same thing that the policeman had attempted
when he coveted their money. The
gun was so precisely what they needed that
it only seemed as though a kind fortune had
presented it to him.</p>

<p>As Raymond straightened up with the revolver
in his hand the prostrate man raised
himself to his elbow. The thick lamb’s
wool cap which he wore, and which is the
usual head-covering of men in the Caucasus,
had so protected his head that the shock
of being thrown against the wall had only
slightly stunned him. Raymond was confronted
with a new danger. With the man
conscious, he would not be able to hide from
him or to escape him in the end, though he
might at first outdistance him in running.</p>

<p>The thought of a possible return to the
filthy jail was more than Raymond could
endure; he simply <em>must</em> prevent any danger
of that. He had a savage, momentary impulse
to shoot the man as he lay before him,
but he could not bring himself to do that,
and, anyway, it would make too much<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
noise. There was one other way, and clubbing
the pistol he brought it down with full
force on the man’s head. The fellow sank
back on the ground without a sound and lay
without moving. Raymond sped on and in
a moment came plump against the wall at
the end, when Sidney hailed him, and he
climbed the ladder.</p>

<p>“Where is that fellow who was chasing
us?” asked Sidney in a whisper, when his
brother appeared at the head of the ladder.</p>

<p>“I tripped him up and he’s down there in
the alley,” replied Raymond in an equally
low tone.</p>

<p>“I thought I heard the sound of a blow,”
said Sidney.</p>

<p>“You did; I clouted him over the head
with his own revolver, and I’ve got the gun
here.”</p>

<p>“I wish you hadn’t done that, Ray.”</p>

<p>“But what <em>could</em> I have done, Sid?&mdash;just
turn my money over to him and wait
meekly to see if he wanted to kill me?”</p>

<p>“Of course not, but you needn’t have
taken his gun.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t going to lose so good a chance
to get a gun, and I simply <em>had</em> to make<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>
him keep quiet till I could get out of the
way.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad enough to have you safe
here, anyway.”</p>

<p>“What kind of a place is this?” asked
Raymond.</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine,” replied his brother.
“I thought it might be the roof of a house
when I climbed the ladder, but there seems
to be a house of some sort up here; I think
that is a door.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we go and investigate,” suggested
Raymond.</p>

<p>“We must be pretty careful if we do;
there may be people here.”</p>

<p>The boys proceeded cautiously toward the
dim opening in the wall that rose on their
right. The surface over which they walked
was smooth, but had the feel, under their
feet, of earth. They paused outside the doorway
and listened intently, but could hear
no sound.</p>

<p>“I’m going to strike a match,” said Raymond,
“and see what there is inside.”</p>

<p>“Don’t make a light out here,” remonstrated
Sidney; “that would show us too
plainly to any one who might be looking this<span class="pagenum">[108]</span>
way. I think it would be safer to step
inside the door. I don’t believe there is any
one here or we should have heard some
sound.”</p>

<p>Raymond stepped carefully inside the
door and struck a match, holding it up till
the flame burned steadily. When the light
shone clear it revealed a good-sized room
that was perfectly bare. The walls were of
rough stone, similar to the walls of the jail,
and the floor was of earth packed hard and
smooth. There was no indication that the
room had been occupied, and it certainly
was empty enough then.</p>

<p>The match died down and Raymond
turned back to the doorway where Sidney
waited. The mystery of their surroundings
made both of them thoughtful,&mdash;the
strange, narrow alley that climbed the steep
hill, shut in on both sides by walls or buildings,
they did not know which; then the
house in whose door they were standing,
that was reached, so far as they knew, only
by a ladder, and that was so providentially
unoccupied; the silence that covered the
place, too, though to be sure it was probably
after midnight, an hour when a town<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
should be silent, if ever. All the conditions
were weird and mysterious.</p>

<p>The boys stood in the doorway and tried
vainly to pierce the darkness about them.
The sky was clear and starlit, but there was
no moon, and the mountains, which seemingly
nearly surrounded them, were black
and without form, and shut out most of
what light there would otherwise have been.
In front of them was the narrow, level
space on which they had landed when they
climbed the ladder, and beyond that fell a
slope which appeared, in the gloom, to be
set with knobs. Whether those knobs were
rocks or buildings the boys could not tell.
They thought, however, that they must be
buildings, else what had become of the village?
Back of them rose the mountains.</p>

<p>“What do you make of it, Sid?” asked
Raymond, still in a whisper, for they had a
sort of feeling that there were people near.</p>

<p>“I can’t make anything of it. If this is a
town, and I suppose it must be, it’s the most
curious one I ever heard of. We’ll just have
to wait till daylight, and I hope we shan’t
find then that we are in the midst of a hornet’s
nest of savage mountaineers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>“We’d better go into that room and get
some sleep,” said Raymond; “I begin to
feel pretty used up after that run uphill. I
should think you’d be too, with the heavy
load you had to carry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it was a hard stunt. What do you
say to pulling the ladder up, Ray? Then if
anybody comes into the alley they can’t get
up here without bringing another ladder.”</p>

<p>“That’s a good idea, Sid. It takes you to
make things safe.”</p>

<p>“And it takes you, Ray, to clear the road
of undesirables. What do you think that
fellow down in the alley will do when he
comes to his senses? I don’t suppose you
really killed him?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, his cap was too thick.
I don’t know whether he will imagine that
we came up here, or not.”</p>

<p>“You know when he said there was no
other village near, I told him that we should
have to go back to Timour Khan Shoura.
I wanted to fool him, and maybe he’ll think
we have started back that way.”</p>

<p>“I hope he will, and chase after us.”
While the boys were talking, they carefully
drew the ladder up and laid it down,<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
well back from the edge. Then they went
into the room, opened up their blankets
close to the wall on one side of the door, and
in about a minute were both fast asleep.</p>

<p><span id="Page_112" class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">IN HIDING</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">When the boys woke in the morning,
they were obliged to think several
minutes in order to remember and comprehend
their situation. Only twenty-four
hours before they had waked in the ravine,
after their nerve-trying battle with the bandits,
the misguided men whom they had left
lying there on the ground. Then followed
their precipitate arrest, and the escape which
had been accomplished in such darkness
that it seemed a miracle that they should
have been able to get away at all. They
wondered if they had chanced upon the one
route that led to, perhaps, the only unoccupied
house in the village.</p>

<p>“I hardly have the courage to look out
of the door, Ray,” said Sidney. “I’m afraid
we’ll find there are houses and people on all
sides of us.”</p>

<p>“If there are, the people certainly don’t
make much noise; we might be in the middle
of a cemetery for all we can hear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[113]</span></p>

<p>Raymond had hardly finished speaking
when there came in at the door the sound of
a voice talking, seemingly so near that the
boys were sure it must be from some person
just outside the door. Another voice
replied, and the two continued in a conversation.</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other in wide-eyed
apprehension, then they raised themselves
cautiously from their blankets and
stood, Raymond with his revolver held at
full cock. They expected every moment
that some one would enter through the door,
and Raymond wondered if it would not be
foolish to resist, after all, if men came to arrest
them. He could, without doubt, shoot
a man or two, perhaps all who came at first,
but they could hardly hope to get away
even then.</p>

<p>The talking outside continued, yet no
one appeared, and when the boys were standing
they could hear more distinctly, and the
voices did not seem quite so near as they
had thought at first. They did not dare to
speak, but they tiptoed carefully to the
door, and standing just inside, listened
again. They were greatly puzzled to locate<span class="pagenum">[114]</span>
the voices; they seemed near, and yet
not as though the persons talking were on
the terrace outside of the door. Finally,
Raymond peered out, and then stepped
into the doorway, but just inside, where he
would be protected from possible observation
except from directly in front. There he
was joined by Sidney.</p>

<p>For the first time the boys saw the prospect
from the door, for darkness had, of
course, prevented their seeing anything before
they went to sleep. They observed that
the space in front of the room where they
had slept was, in fact, a terrace. It was some
fifteen feet wide and was then cut square
down. The voices which they heard rose
from some lower level which they could not
see, apparently close under the wall that
descended from the edge of the terrace, and
at no great distance.</p>

<p>Beyond the level whence came the voices,
however, the view was unobstructed, and
the boys were amazed by what they saw.
The steep slope below them was thickly
clothed with houses constructed in terraces,
apparently with no intervening streets, the
front yard of one house being also the roof<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
of the next house below. The buildings
were all of rough stone and the walls were
not finished smooth with mortar or plaster,
so that, seen at a distance, the village might
easily be taken for a collection of rocks on
the side of the mountain. On some of the
terraces in front of the houses they saw
horses calmly eating their provender on the
roofs of their neighbors. They also saw people
moving about, undoubtedly attending
to their customary occupations.</p>

<p>Beyond the village in front lay the narrow
valley, and beyond that mountains, but the
great range extended across the horizon
more to the right, and rose high and formidable
against the clear sky. The village,
plainly, was situated among the foothills,
right at the base of the towering range which
they had yet to cross.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Sidney, after they had
looked for a few moments in silence, “if
the houses continue up the mountain above
this one. Do you suppose we are surrounded
by houses and people as thick as they are
below?”</p>

<p>“I wish we could see to the sides and
back,” said Raymond. “There is one thing<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>
sure, this terrace out here in front is the
roof of a house.”</p>

<p>The conversation of their neighbors just
below continued at intervals, and the sound
of the voices came up to them with great
distinctness. The boys imagined the two
men who were talking to be sitting in the
sun in front of their own door. There were
no sounds audible from the rear, but if there
were people above them, any noise which
they made would, of course, be heard more
readily above than below. There were no
windows in the room where they had passed
the night, no opening except the door, and
there seemed to be no way for them to obtain
a view to one side or the other except
by exposing themselves in front.</p>

<p>“I’m going to see if I can’t look around
the wall to one side without being seen,”
said Raymond, edging forward on one side
of the doorway as far as he could go without
actually passing beyond the line of the front
wall.</p>

<p>“Gee! Sid,” he exclaimed, after taking a
look, “the alley that we came up last night
is a street with houses opening on it. But I
don’t believe there are any more houses as<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>
high up as this one. You take a look.” And
he made way for Sidney.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” said Sidney, “and if you
look sharp you can see the tops of ladders
on the line of the alley that runs down the
hill. That must be a favorite way of getting
into the houses. They are regular cliff-dwellers.
I should think we’d have blundered
into some of those ladders last night; it’s
lucky we didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Some of the doors must open on a level,”
said Raymond, “and there must be other
alleys that run up through the houses; that’s
the way those horses got out there.”</p>

<p>“This is the last house up,” said Sidney,
who had shifted to the other side of the
doorway and was looking out beyond the
house to the right; “there is nothing but
mountain out there.”</p>

<p>“This is the first house on a new street,
Sid. I guess it was built to rent, and they
hadn’t got a tenant yet.”</p>

<p>“I hope the owner won’t come to look at
it to-day. If we can stay here till night without
being found, Ray, I’ll bet we can get
away after dark.”</p>

<p>“I wish we might step outside,” suggested<span class="pagenum">[118]</span>
Raymond, “and see how the mountain
looks. Maybe we could locate the trail
where it leaves the village.”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t be safe,” replied his
brother, “but I’m sure the trail must go out
up the valley, and then enter a ravine that
narrows up. If we go along the mountain
beyond the houses and then drop down to
the valley, we can probably find it in the
dark.”</p>

<p>“There may be half a dozen trails,” said
Raymond, “that run out after firewood,
and it will be mighty ticklish business to
pick out the main one.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it will be,” replied Sidney, “but
we’ll have to take that chance.”</p>

<p>The boys began to realize that they had
had no breakfast, and the situation was not
made more cheerful when they remembered
that the knapsacks contained only dry
bread and cheese. Moreover, the cheese
was very salty, and as there was no water
they did not dare to eat it, for fear of creating
a consuming thirst which could not be
allayed. So the breakfast menu was reduced
to dry bread only. They ate that as slowly
as possible, taking very small pieces and<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
chewing each piece a long time. Even with
such a highly hygienic method as that the
meal was only too quickly finished. When
breakfast was out of the way, Raymond
took up his new revolver, which he had not
had time to examine.</p>

<p>“Now, Sid,” said he, “I’ll clean my gun
while you are doing up the dishes.”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Sidney; “when I get
a lot of dishes in the rinsing water, I’ll call
on you to dry them.”</p>

<p>“If you do, I’ll drink some of the rinsing
water first. Gee, but I’m thirsty!”
Raymond found that the gun was a six-shot
revolver of English make; rather antiquated
in style but in serviceable condition.
He took it all apart and wiped the pieces
and the inside of the barrel carefully with a
bit of rag, polishing the barrel until every
atom shone. He spent so much time on the
work that Sidney, who had nothing to do,
became restless.</p>

<p>“What will you do, Ray,” he asked, “if
some one comes before you put your gun
together again?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll just point the barrel at them;
that will scare them away. But seriously,<span class="pagenum">[120]</span>
Sid, if somebody should come I don’t believe
it would do to try to stand them off.
If I shot a man or two, it would probably
only be worse for us in the end, for we certainly
couldn’t get away. If they didn’t
dare come right in and take us, it would
only be a question of starving us out.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so. I guess we should have
to take our medicine if we were discovered.”
Sidney had been watching his brother at
work on the gun. As he finished speaking he
glanced up and there was a little child peering
in at the door. The little fellow, as soon
as he saw the boys, turned and fled. Sidney
jumped up and ran to the door and saw the
child scampering away along the side of
the mountain. Raymond, in his occupation
with the revolver, had not seen their visitor,
but when Sidney rushed so precipitately to
the door, he followed in alarm.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s all up with us now, Sid,” he
said when he saw the child. “That little
rascal is sure to tell that he saw us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he will. He’s scared now,
but he will forget all about it as soon as he
meets somebody. He’s too young to remember
long.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[121]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I shall have nervous prostration
if we keep getting such jolts as this all day.
I shall be glad when it’s dark again.”</p>

<p>The day seemed interminable to the boys,
for there was nothing to do, and they did
not dare even to step outside, for fear of being
seen. Raymond persisted in believing
that the tiny spy who had looked in at the
door would report their presence. There
was no alarm, however, as the day wore on,
and he was finally obliged to confess that
Sidney’s prediction was probably accurate,
and that the child had forgotten the incident
as soon as it was past.</p>

<p>The varied noises of village life rose to
the lonely house and gave a pleasing sense
of neighborliness to the boys in spite of the
possibility of danger that the sounds suggested.
Three or four horsemen galloped
in, seemingly on the road by which the boys
had arrived. The sunlight glistened from
the bright metal trimmings of saddle and
bridle, and from the guns and the silver
cartridge cases which the men wore on their
coat fronts. If the arms had been omitted,
the long dark coats, with skirts that covered
the horses’ sides, and the black lamb’s wool<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>
caps worn by the men, would have made
them appear like a company of priests.</p>

<p>“Gee! don’t I wish I had one of those
horses!” sighed Raymond. “It’s hard lines
for a Texan to have to go afoot.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sidney, “we proved, that
winter in Mexico, that Texans can walk if
necessary.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we never had such mountains
as those to cross.” And Raymond looked
distrustfully on the tremendous range that
rose above the horizon.</p>

<p>“What bothers me most,” said Sidney,
“is the thought of cold weather and snow
over the summit. It must get pretty cold
up there a little later. We’ll have to do our
very best hiking as soon as we get out of
this place.”</p>

<p>As afternoon advanced the boys became
so thirsty that hunger was forgotten and
they could not endure the thought of dry
food. The desire for water increased until
it amounted to torture. They paced restlessly
across the room, back and forth, in
absolute silence, with no heart for talk.</p>

<p>“Sid,” asked Raymond, when the sun
had dropped behind the mountain at the<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
back, and long shadows lay across the valley,
“how much longer will we have to
wait?”</p>

<p>“Until it’s good and dark.”</p>

<p>“But then we shan’t know where to get
water.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be far to the mouth of the cañon
above the village, and we’re almost sure to
find water there.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I’m going to stand it,
Sid. I’d go back to the jail if I could have a
good drink.”</p>

<p>“You see, Ray, it’s not just a question of
going back to the jail. We can’t tell what
they would do with us for killing the bandits.
I don’t know of any way we could prove we
did it in self-defense.”</p>

<p>“Well, I almost wish that policeman would
find us; that would settle it.”</p>

<p>“I’m surprised he hasn’t,” said Sidney,
“but I think he must have believed that we
went back to Timour Khan Shoura. And I
think, too, that he was trying to work a
little private graft of his own. I don’t believe
he reported that we got out. He probably
went back on the road to try to overtake
and rob us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[124]</span></p>

<p>“And here we’ve had to stay all day,”
growled Raymond, “with water in the
house right below us. I’ve a good mind to
go down there now and get a drink.” For
the thought of the possible water so near
was almost more than the boy could endure.</p>

<p>“It won’t be long now, Ray,” said Sidney
encouragingly; “see, it’s almost dark down
in the valley now. You’ve been too fine the
last few days to give up just because you’re
thirsty.”</p>

<p>“Let’s stop talking about it, Sid,” groaned
Raymond. “It makes me wild to think of
water.” And Raymond took up the endless
tramp again to wear away the time.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">WITHOUT WATER</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">At last the hour came when Sidney
judged it was dark enough for them
to venture out. He did not think it necessary
to wait until late at night, for as soon
as they could leave the house they would
climb a little way up the mountain and then
pass along the slope at some distance above
the village. Moreover, all the houses opened
toward the valley, and like their place of
refuge had no windows facing the mountain.
It seemed, then, that there would be
little danger of discovery as soon as it was
dark enough to prevent their being seen at a
distance.</p>

<p>The boys rolled up their blankets and
disposed of their packs to the best advantage
for traveling, then left their shelter
with feverish haste in their longing to reach
water. The mountain along which they had
to pass was bare, as all southern slopes are
in Eastern and Central Daghestan. With
practically no growth of bushes, and with<span class="pagenum">[126]</span>
only broken rocks to retard them, their way
was not difficult, even in the dark, and they
made good progress.</p>

<p>Sidney again proved himself to be a good
prophet, for their departure was not seen,
and no one appeared to stop them. They
stumbled along in the dark over the rocky
surface, and soon were beyond what seemed
to be the extreme limit of the village. However,
to insure security, they went half a
mile farther, and then descended to the
valley.</p>

<p>At the foot of the mountain they encountered
a well-traveled trail, but as it was
plain that they had not yet reached the
lowest level of the valley, they decided to
continue a little farther on the same line in
the hope of finding water. So they went
straight forward and soon crossed the wash
of a stream, but alas! it was dry. They
thought it might be that it was only a tributary
wash and that they had not yet come
to the main stream, and they went on, only
to realize after a little that they were climbing
an ascent. That convinced them, with a
shock, that they had, indeed, crossed the
bottom of the valley without finding water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p>

<p>“What shall we do, Sid?” asked Raymond
with a tremble in his voice.</p>

<p>“We must go back to the trail and follow
that up to the mountains. The stream
probably doesn’t flow much below the
mouth of the cañon, and when we get up
there we’ll find it.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Raymond, in a tone
that contradicted his words.</p>

<p>They turned back on their course, crossed
the wash again, and climbing a gentle rise
reached the trail. Turning into that to the
left they plodded doggedly on. They had
encountered only one trail, and as that
was well traveled, they had assumed that it
must be the main road into the mountains,
therefore the one they wanted. So they
followed it without hesitation.</p>

<p>As they proceeded they entered more directly
under the brow of the mountains and
the darkness increased. The trail was so well
defined, however, that they had no difficulty
in following it, even when they could
not really see the road they were traveling.
On and on they went, with only one thought,
to hurry forward, the sooner to reach water.</p>

<p>The boys had eaten nothing since early in<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
the day, for after they had become so thirsty
they could not endure the thought of dry
food. And they ate very little the day before
while in the jail, for even when there
was water to assist, the food they had was
very unpalatable. So their strength was
failing greatly, though they hardly realized
it, even unconsciously, and certainly did
not think about it, in their frenzy to reach
the mouth of the cañon where they expected
to find water.</p>

<p>The two raced on at a speed which, under
ordinary conditions, and without the stimulus
of an overpowering desire, would have
soon exhausted them. They kept the trail
in the dark with the instinct that is shown
by animals, rather than by any exercise of
reason, and they paid no attention to its
direction so long as they were advancing,
as they supposed, to water. With the terrible
disappointment they had experienced
in finding a dry wash where they had expected
a stream, their desire for water had
increased so greatly as to be fairly consuming,
and left no room for any other
thought.</p>

<p>Suddenly Sidney, who was in the lead,<span class="pagenum">[129]</span>
stopped short,&mdash;so suddenly in his swift
course that his brother plunged forcibly
against him. When Raymond had recovered
his balance he asked anxiously, in a
strained, unnatural voice,&mdash;</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Sid?”</p>

<p>“See that trail!” replied Sidney.</p>

<p>Raymond stooped and peered at the
ground in the darkness. The trail turned
back at a sharp angle and ascended in almost
the opposite direction, plainly the
first turn of a switchback that climbed the
mountain.</p>

<p>“That means we’re on the wrong road,”
said Sidney. “I’m sure the road we want
doesn’t go up over the mountain like that,
and, anyway, we shan’t find water this
way.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to go back,” said Raymond
in a hopeless tone, “and hunt for another
trail.”</p>

<p>“It’s a long way,” said Sidney doubtfully.
“I think we must have been tramping
fully two hours, and after we found another
trail we’d have to follow it up to water,
maybe two hours longer. I doubt if we are
equal to that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[130]</span></p>

<p>With the new disappointment, after the
great exertion that had preceded it, the
boys had nearly collapsed. Their legs gave
way under them and they sank to the
ground.</p>

<p>“Sid!”&mdash;and there was a note of terror
in Raymond’s voice&mdash;“maybe this country
is like Lower California, and there is no
surface water.”</p>

<p>“It can’t be; there are so many people
living here.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps the people in the village
get all their water from wells.”</p>

<p>“That’s so; I never thought of that;
maybe they do.”</p>

<p>“I’m going back to the village, Sid, for
water.” And Raymond struggled to his
feet.</p>

<p>“We must not do a foolish thing, Ray,
just because we feel desperate. If we go
back I don’t believe we’ll ever leave there
alive. I think there is water in the cañon
above the village, too, for you know there
was running water where we camped below.”</p>

<p>Raymond hesitated, partly convinced by
his brother’s reasoning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[131]</span></p>

<p>“What do you propose to do?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I think it’s too far to go back by the
trail,” replied Sidney, “and we can’t get
straight down the mountain in the dark. I
blame myself for not noticing that we
were climbing quite a grade, but that can’t
be helped now, and really, I could hardly
think of anything but water.”</p>

<p>“I can’t think of anything else now. You
were not to blame, Sid, any more than I
was. We were simply frantic, both of us.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think, Ray, that we could
stay here till daylight? That would be better
than to blunder around in the dark, and
wear ourselves out, and perhaps break our
arms and legs.”</p>

<p>Raymond stood without replying, and
Sidney continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>“We can leave here just as soon as it is
light enough to get down the mountain.
We can go straight down, then, and it probably
won’t be more than two or three miles.
And I believe we’ll find water when we get
there, Ray. It will be flowing in the mouth
of the cañon, if anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Can you stay here till morning without
water, Sid?” asked Raymond finally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

<p>“I believe I can, because I think it’s the
only thing for us to do. It will be hard, I
admit. I would rather have a drink now
than anything else under Heaven.”</p>

<p>Raymond threw his blankets down on the
ground and began to unroll them without
speaking.</p>

<p>“Won’t you eat a little bread first, Ray?”
asked his brother.</p>

<p>“No; I can’t eat.”</p>

<p>“I think we ought to eat something,
though. If we don’t we’ll be so weak by
morning we shan’t be able to reach water.
If we chew the driest part of the bread very
thoroughly we can swallow it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Raymond dully; “give
me a piece.”</p>

<p>Sidney opened his knapsack, felt for the
driest piece of bread, and, breaking off the
driest portion of that, handed it to Raymond.
Then he selected a bit for himself
and they sat on their blankets and munched
the crusts. Even with the most faithful
chewing they found it difficult to swallow
the morsels, but they persevered and managed
to consume nearly all of the pieces
which Sidney had apportioned them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[133]</span></p>

<p>Then they opened their blankets on the
smoothest bit of ground they could find in
the dark, and huddled down in them. Neither
boy felt like talking. The reclining
position was a relief, for their fatigue was
great, but the rest it brought was more a
sort of apathy than sleep.</p>

<p>They had not been lying long when Raymond
began to mutter and talk unintelligibly
and frequently started up violently.
Sidney spoke to him at such times, but was
unable to attract his attention, so finally,
when the boy sprang up in such a frenzy,
Sidney would reach out and place his hand
soothingly on Raymond’s shoulder or his
hand, and that always quieted him.</p>

<p>That occurred at such frequent intervals
that it seemed to Sidney as though it had
gone on forever, and would continue without
end. He would no more than settle
down in his blankets and sink into a delicious
stupor when Raymond would jump
up and cry out, and he would have to take
hold of him to quiet him. So it went with
almost mechanical regularity until Sidney
was dazed.</p>

<p>But extreme exhaustion at length prevailed<span class="pagenum">[134]</span>
and both boys lay without moving.
That change took place so near morning that
when the boys had become quiet they did
not wake early as they intended. They did
not rouse at all until the sun shone hot upon
them, then Sidney opened his eyes. He
could not remember at first where he was.
His mouth felt queer and stiff and uncomfortably
full of something. He looked about,
vaguely at first, when his gaze rested on
Raymond and it all came back to him. He
remembered their flight in the dark from
the village, their having taken the wrong
road, and their failure to find water.</p>

<p>The thought of water brought Sidney’s
mind back to his own condition and he realized
that the something which filled his
mouth so uncomfortably was his tongue,
which was badly swollen. That realization
made him get up as quickly as he was able.
He stood and looked down into the valley.
The trail which they had followed by mistake
had taken them along the side of the
mountain until they were directly above the
gorge that narrowed from the upper end of
the valley. Down there, glistening in the
sun, perhaps two miles away, Sidney saw a<span class="pagenum">[135]</span>
thread of water. At the sight he started to
plunge down the mountain to reach it, but
he had taken no more than two or three
steps when he remembered with a shock
that he was leaving his brother behind.</p>

<p>With a crucial effort Sidney relinquished
the thought of prompt relief and turned
back and spoke to Raymond in a voice that
was thick and unmanageable, but received
no reply. Then he stooped and took hold of
him, but was obliged to shake him several
times before he roused.</p>

<p>Raymond finally looked around and sat
up, but did not seem to comprehend what
was wanted. Sidney tried to explain that
there was water in sight, but his voice was
little more than a croak. At last he succeeded
in getting Raymond on his feet and
started with him down the mountain. Each
boy wore his knapsack still slung over his
shoulder, but their blankets and cloaks
they did not think about, and left lying on
the ground.</p>

<p>It was a difficult task that Sidney had
before him. His own wits were so befuddled
by raging thirst that he could not think
clearly, and it was only by a supreme effort<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
of the will that he could fix his mind on a
subject and keep it there. Two days and
nights only without water, but when his
mind tried to go back to that last drink in
the jail, it seemed as though half a lifetime
must have passed since.</p>

<p>Raymond was able to help himself very
little; he could only stumble forward when
he was guided and supported by his brother.
In that way they proceeded slowly down
the mountain slope. Sidney had almost uncontrollable
impulses to desert his brother
and rush headlong down the hill to the water
which he knew was at its foot, but he
had a dim, undefined fear that if he did that
he would not get back to Raymond until it
was too late. So he stuck by his brother
and they went down together.</p>

<p>Two miles is not far, and it was probably
not more than that from the place where
the boys slept, or rather where they passed
the night, on the mountain, down to the
bottom of the gorge. Moreover, the goal
was in plain view, and every step was down
hill. But to Sidney, who was nearly at the
point of collapse, and who was burdened
with his almost insensible brother, the distance<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
over the rocky, broken ground seemed
interminable.</p>

<p>The boys stumbled along, Sidney dragging
his brother and sometimes falling and
picking himself up with difficulty. Raymond,
too, frequently fell over rocks and
into holes, and was pulled up by his companion.
Each time that happened it became
increasingly difficult to put the boy on his
feet again.</p>

<p>Hours, it seemed to Sidney, passed in the
endless struggle. Finally, however, they
reached a point where the descent became
abruptly much steeper, the last nearly a
perpendicular drop to the bottom of the
gorge. That was the hardest stretch of all.
Down that declivity Sidney went first, supporting
his brother’s weight on his shoulders.
It was but little better than carrying
an inert body, and the boy trembled with
the strain. But it came to an end, and with
his nearly inanimate burden he dropped on
the sand at the bottom of the cliff.</p>

<p>Sidney lay there panting, his parched
nostrils unable properly to admit air to his
lungs, and his mouth and throat so swollen
and dry that but little aid was possible that<span class="pagenum">[138]</span>
way. For a few moments he nearly lost
consciousness; then came a remembrance of
the salvation that was so near, and he struggled
to his feet and staggered the few yards
to the little stream. Throwing himself on
the ground, with his scooped hand he dashed
water into his mouth and over his face.</p>

<p>Oh, the blessed, indescribable relief that
moisture gave! But with the return of reason
that it brought came the memory of his
brother, and with an almost superhuman
effort of self-restraint, Sidney dipped up
water in his hat and went back to Raymond.
Kneeling by the unconscious boy’s side, he
plunged his hand into the water and dripped
the life-giving fluid into Raymond’s mouth
and over his face. Occasionally he allowed
himself the luxury of a sip, but he resolutely
refused to allow his own desire to interfere
with his ministry to his brother, until Raymond
began to stir and opened his eyes.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">RESTING</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">The return of the boys to anything like
a normal condition was very slow,
though Sidney had the courage and good
sense to parcel out the water, both to himself
and to Raymond. He allowed his
brother to take only a swallow or two at
intervals, and he restrained himself in the
same way. At first it required a self-control
that was almost beyond his strength, but as
they absorbed the restoring fluid their ravening,
consuming appetite decreased, and
it became a joy, instead of a tantalizing
torture, to sip the water slowly. Presently,
too, as their mouths and throats became
softened they were able to talk, if not with
ease, at least with little difficulty.</p>

<p>“That was as near as I want to come to
passing in my checks, Sid,” said Raymond
as they lay on the sand below the cañon
wall.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was quite close enough.”</p>

<p>“I would have done it, too, if I had been<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>
alone. You must have just dragged me down
the mountain.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t seem very anxious to come,
and that’s a fact.”</p>

<p>“You know, Sid, I don’t remember a
thing after we lay down last night, but I had
the most delightful dreams.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t act as though they were
delightful.”</p>

<p>“Why, what did I do?”</p>

<p>“You kept jumping up and calling out.”</p>

<p>“And keeping you awake, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes, a little.”</p>

<p>“Poor old Sid; you have a hard time getting
me through.”</p>

<p>“But when it comes to gun play, then
you take care of us both.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s one thing I can do,&mdash;handle
a gun.”</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll not have any more of it to
do, though.”</p>

<p>“Do you think, Sid, that we are safe
here? I haven’t looked, but I should think
the trail that we missed last night must
pass through this gorge.”</p>

<p>“Yes, it does. I saw the tracks out there
in the sand.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[141]</span></p>

<p>“I suppose it must be traveled occasionally.”
And Raymond stood up and looked
along the cañon wall. “That looks like a
little ravine coming in up there. Let’s see
if there isn’t some place that we can crawl
into for shelter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess we’d better.” And Sidney
stood up and stretched stiffly. “We are certainly
too exposed here. But do you know,
Ray, I’m so lame and sore that I can hardly
move.”</p>

<p>“I’m not very lame,&mdash;just tired, that’s
all; but then you worked harder than I
did.”</p>

<p>The boys moved slowly along the sand to
the cleft in the cañon wall which Raymond
had indicated. They found a very narrow
chasm that had been cut through the rock
by the occasional torrential rains of centuries.
Its bottom, for some yards back, was
on a level with the sandy floor of the cañon
and was not more than ten feet wide. Overhead
the cleft was very irregular, in places
the two walls nearly coming together. Extending
back on the right side beneath the
overhanging rock was a sheltered space,
very like a small cave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[142]</span></p>

<p>“Gee! Sid,” exclaimed Raymond, “that’s
a fine place, and nobody can see us from the
cañon. But, jiminy! where are our blankets?
Did we leave them up on the mountain?”</p>

<p>“I guess we did. I hadn’t thought of
them at all. But I don’t believe I can crawl
up there after them to-night; I feel too gone
for anything.”</p>

<p>“No wonder you feel gone,” said Raymond;
“we haven’t eaten a thing to-day.
We’ve been so busy drinking since we got
down to the cañon that I had forgotten all
about grub.”</p>

<p>“I can’t remember exactly,” said Sidney,
“but I don’t think there is much grub.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s some, anyway. You get
out what there is, Sid, and I’ll take the cup
and bring up some water. I feel as though I
should want to keep right on drinking forever.”</p>

<p>It had been very late in the morning when
the boys roused from their night of stupor
on the side of the mountain, and then it had
taken a long time for Sidney to get himself
and his brother down to the bottom of the
cañon. After they had reached water they
were also a long time in getting back any<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
semblance of strength, so when they retreated
to the little cave under the cañon
wall, it was nearly night and the sun had
already dropped back of the mountains.</p>

<p>Sidney, when he examined the knapsacks,
found there was a moderate supply
of bread and cheese. The latter, with water
to remove the effect of its salty condition,
was extremely palatable, and the boys made
what they declared was a sumptuous supper.</p>

<p>“Do you realize, Sid,” said Raymond, as
they lay on the sand munching bread and
cheese, and frequently sipping water, of
which they seemed never to be able to get
enough, “that we have eaten nothing for
twenty-four hours, and then only a little
bread in that deserted house, because we
had no water to wash it down? And we’ve
done some strenuous work since, too.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t eaten much, but you know
we did eat a little bread up on the mountain
last night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember eating any bread,”
declared Raymond.</p>

<p>“Have you forgotten how I urged you to
eat something, and you finally took a dry
crust?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[144]</span></p>

<p>“Yes; I don’t remember a thing about it.
But I do remember the dreams I had. I was
in swimming most of the time, and it was
always down in Mexico, in the Conchos
River. Gee, but it was fine!”</p>

<p>“If it was so fine I don’t see why you
made such a rumpus.”</p>

<p>“I suppose I was swimming hard, and
splashing around.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t observe much splashing. It was
a mighty dry swim.” And Sidney laughed
rather ruefully.</p>

<p>“Do you know what the date is, Sid?”</p>

<p>“No, I haven’t the least idea, and I don’t
believe I could figure it out, after all we
have done.”</p>

<p>“Do you suppose it’s September yet?”</p>

<p>“September,” repeated Sidney thoughtfully;
“maybe it is. I should think it might
be December.”</p>

<p>The boys had by that time finished their
supper, and Sidney carefully packed away
the bread and cheese that was left. Then
they stretched out on the sand, beginning
to feel quite like themselves again.</p>

<p>“I wish I knew where father is,” said
Sidney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[145]</span></p>

<p>“He may be back in New York by this
time.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think he can be,” exclaimed
Sidney. Then, after a moment of reflection,
“Still, he may be, too. I hope he is.”</p>

<p>“Are you sorry we started out the way we
did?” asked Raymond.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know,” replied Sidney.
“If we had known the Russian Government
was going to be so good to Americans, we
might have waited in Nizhni-Novgorod.
But we did what we thought was the best
thing.”</p>

<p>“Gee! but that was a long time ago,”
said Raymond. “If we had only been able
to send a message to mother! She must
have had a tough time waiting in New York
after she knew about the war.”</p>

<p>“Yes; I feel worse about that than anything
else.” And there was a suspicion of
moisture in Sidney’s eyes. “Poor mother!
I suppose we ought not to have insisted on
coming when she was so opposed to it.”</p>

<p>“But who could have imagined there
would be such a war? Even mother thought
we should be safe from war over here. And
father wanted to come, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[146]</span></p>

<p>“Well, father is about as much of a boy
as we are.”</p>

<p>“This is the toughest proposition we were
ever up against, Sid.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is, and after we are over the
mountains we don’t know what we’ll strike
on the other side.”</p>

<p>“Maybe America will join in the war by
that time, and we’ll be arrested as spies.”</p>

<p>“That couldn’t be,” said Sidney. “If
America goes in she’ll be on the side of England
and France and Russia. So I think
we’ll be safe till we reach the Black Sea;
then there’s no knowing what Turkey may
do to us.”</p>

<p>“It would sure be a comfort to know
what’s going on.”</p>

<p>As Raymond spoke, the boys heard
voices, and peering around the corner of
rock they saw two horsemen cantering down
the cañon.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we had sense to hide,” said
Raymond, as they watched the men. “I
should think those fellows would swelter in
their long coats and those awful woolly
caps.”</p>

<p>“I’m wondering,” said Sidney, “how<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>
much travel there is on that other trail. I
feel so much better now that I’ve a good
mind to go up after our blankets.”</p>

<p>“It would be dark before you could
get there. We’d better wait till morning.
That’s probably only a wood trail and
there won’t be much travel over it.”</p>

<p>“If it’s a wood trail,” suggested Sidney,
“somebody may start out after wood early
in the morning, or somebody may have
come down to-night, already.”</p>

<p>“Well, if they’ve come down already,”
said Raymond, “we can’t do any good by
going up now.”</p>

<p>“It’s not going to be very comfortable
here to-night without any blankets.” And
Sidney looked about them suggestively.</p>

<p>“Oh, it won’t be so bad,” said Raymond;
“we can stretch out on the sand, and it’s
not cold.”</p>

<p>The relief brought by food and drink
after their privation, and the delightful
peace of calm security after their strenuous
exertions, induced a languid drowsiness
that became sleep almost as soon as the
boys had lain down.</p>

<p>A cold night wind came down off the high<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
mountains and whistled and wailed through
the little ravine, but the boys in their cave
were out of its course, and its moaning, instead
of disturbing them, made them sleep
sounder. As they had gone to sleep, however,
with the closing-in of night, the long
hours before morning brought thorough
rest, and they were awake by break of day.</p>

<p>Raymond proposed that they should go
up after their blankets before eating breakfast,
and so perhaps get ahead of any early
wood-chopper. The slope did not look so
long as it had seemed the night before, and
they were soon halfway up it. At that
height they could see the village from which
they had escaped, looking, from that distance,
like a collection of big rocks. And
they saw, too, coming on the trail which
they had taken in the dark, a man who was
driving a donkey ahead of him.</p>

<p>“There’s our wood-chopper, Ray,” said
Sidney, “and he’s going to reach the blankets
ahead of us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, he can’t get away with them,
and we can take care of one man all right.”</p>

<p>Hurry as the boys might, the man with
the donkey arrived first. He was, apparently,<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
ignorant that there was any one near
him, but the boys were sure that he must
have seen them on the bare slope. When he
came to the blankets he stopped and examined
them for a moment, then quickly gathering
them up, he threw them across the
donkey and started on.</p>

<p>“Hold on, there!” shouted Raymond.</p>

<p>The man, however, instead of stopping,
tried to whip his donkey to a swifter gait.
But the little animal was so used to traveling
at a walk that it could not be persuaded
to go faster, and the boys soon overhauled
them.</p>

<p>Raymond ran up on one side of the donkey,
and taking hold of his head, stopped
him. <a id="Ref_149a" href="#Ref_149">The man, on the other side, drew a
wicked-looking knife</a> and reaching across
the animal’s back made a lunge at Raymond.
Sidney, who was a few steps behind,
saw the movement and cried a warning
to his brother, who leaped back in time
to avoid the thrust.</p>

<div class="caption"><p class="center"><a href="#Ref_149a">THE FELLOW DREW A WICKED LOOKING KNIFE</a></p></div>
</div>

<p>“Oh, no, you don’t!” cried Raymond,
and whipping out his revolver he covered
the man with it.</p>

<p>The fellow stood, without flinching,<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>
watching them with gleaming eyes while
Sidney removed the blankets and cloaks
from the donkey’s back.</p>

<p>“Now, go on,” ordered Raymond, motioning
up the trail.</p>

<p>The man sulkily took charge of his donkey,
and drove the animal along without
once looking back.</p>

<span class="cheaderfont">THEIR FIRST GAME</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">“If we had waited for breakfast,” said
Sidney, as the boys stood watching the
mountaineer climb the switchback of the
trail, “we should have been minus our
blankets.”</p>

<p>“Gracious! It makes me shiver just to
think of hiking over those mountains without
any blankets.” And Raymond gazed
off at the Caucasus, whose crests shone
white in the clear morning air.</p>

<p>“And speaking of breakfast,” said Sidney,
as he made his blanket and cloak into
the usual roll for packing, “reminds me
that I’ll be quite ready for it when we get
down to the bottom.”</p>

<p>“I wish there was a good breakfast ready
for us,” said Raymond, as they started down
the mountain. “I’m tired to death of that
everlasting dry bread.”</p>

<p>“Dry bread, you know, is more hygienic
than fresh bread.”</p>

<p>“It may be hygienic, but it’s not high<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
living. I just long for something really
tasty, like quail or rabbit.”</p>

<p>“Well, there are rabbits here. I saw one
this morning down in the cañon. Do you
think you could hit one with that revolver?”</p>

<p>“Of course I could hit one! What’s the
matter with you?”</p>

<p>“Then I hope we’ll see another.”</p>

<p>The long night’s rest, after food and
drink, had made the boys feel so fine that
they already had little to remind them of
their trying experience of the previous two
days. They went down the mountain at a
swinging gait, and as they approached the
bottom, Raymond’s mind reverted with
longing to the subject of rabbit.</p>

<p>“Sid,” he suggested, “if you’ll hang back
a little I’ll go on ahead and maybe I’ll see a
rabbit as we near the cañon.”</p>

<p>“All right,” agreed Sidney. “You’d better
give me your blankets; you don’t want
to be bothered with them if you’re going to
shoot.”</p>

<p>Raymond passed his blanket roll over to
Sidney, who sat down on a rock to give his
brother time to get ahead. The boy proceeded
cautiously down the slope with his<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>
revolver held ready, but rabbits were, apparently,
either very scarce or very shy,
for none appeared. He stopped on the brink
of the steeper descent just before the bottom,
and after pausing to make an examination
there, he turned and called out to Sidney
in a disgusted tone,&mdash;</p>

<p>“No use, Sid; come on.”</p>

<p>The boys clambered down the rocks and
trudged through the sand to their camping-place,
Raymond grumbling as they went.</p>

<p>“Tough luck, I say, not to see hide or
hair of a rabbit, hungry as we are.”</p>

<p>They reached the little ravine, and there,
just inside the entrance, sat a big gray rabbit!</p>

<p>Raymond threw up his revolver, and
bringing it down, fired as it came to a level.
It was done in an instant, without apparent
preparation, and yet there on the sand with
the greater part of its head missing, lay the
rabbit.</p>

<p>“You are certainly a crackerjack with
the gun, Ray,” exclaimed Sidney admiringly.
“If I had tried that I should have
blown the rabbit all to pieces, or else missed
him entirely.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[154]</span></p>

<p>“It all depends on believing you’re going
to hit. And don’t hesitate; fire as soon as
you see your game through the sight.”</p>

<p>“But you don’t sight at all, you just fire
regardless.”</p>

<p>Raymond laughed. “Well, I guess it’s
instinct.”</p>

<p>While Raymond was dressing the game
Sidney gathered an armful of bits of wood
and brush, and carrying the fuel up into the
little ravine, he built a fire in an angle where
it could not be seen from the cañon. He fed
the blaze until, by the time Raymond had
the rabbit cleaned and quartered, there was
a thick bed of coals. Then the boys sharpened
sticks and holding the pieces of meat
over the coals roasted them beautifully.</p>

<p>The meal that followed, Raymond declared
was fit to be served on Olympus. It
would, perhaps, have been improved with a
little salt, for the boys had forgotten to supply
themselves with that desirable condiment.
But the delicious roast meat was so
much more savory than anything they had
eaten for days, and so much better than
they expected to have, that it seemed
absolutely perfect. Besides furnishing an<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>
ample breakfast, there was enough meat
left for another meal, and that they packed
in the knapsacks with the bread and cheese.</p>

<p>By the time breakfast was concluded the
day was far advanced toward noon, and the
boys hastened on their way. The trail up
the cañon, though the bottom was very
sandy, was sufficiently plain to leave the
travelers in no doubt. After two or three
miles, too, where the cañon became narrow
and rocky, the trail turned to the right up
the mountain, and there, on the harder
ground, it was well beaten.</p>

<p>To the inexperienced traveler it would
have seemed that the traffic must be very
considerable to maintain so well-defined a
road. The boys, however, were familiar
with a land of scanty rainfall and knew that
in such a dry region tracks are obliterated
very slowly. So they were not uneasy about
meeting people, for they knew that they
might possibly travel two or three days and
see no one. If they might only be allowed
to place a reasonably safe distance between
themselves and the village where they had
had such an unpleasant adventure, they
would rather meet people than not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[156]</span></p>

<p>The road plunged at once into difficult
mountains, more difficult than the boys had
ever seen before. They did not know that
the region is called the “Russian Alps,”
and that it furnishes scenery which is
grander and more magnificent than that in
the true Alps. The road would climb up out
of a cañon for two or three thousand feet by
a series of zigzags over a lofty divide, and
descend by another switchback into a similar
cañon on the other side. The cañons
were narrow, deep, and gloomy, and were
crowded so closely together that there was
absolutely no level ground between.</p>

<p>From the summit of any high divide the
boys looked off both ways and saw only a
confused jumble of mountains and ravines,
picked out by occasional salient peaks.
Sometimes there was a descent of not more
than a mile in a direct line, and yet the road
was so tortuous that half a day of strenuous
walking was required to reach the bottom.</p>

<p>On the sides of the cañons were perched
villages, curious collections of rough rock
houses, always above the bottom of the
cañon, and often far above, away out of
reach, except by an hour of hard climbing.<span class="pagenum">[157]</span>
As the boys advanced into the mountains
the villages were situated at greater heights,
and were more difficult of access.</p>

<p>For many hundreds of years the great
Caucasian Range was a harbor of refuge
for oppressed people of various nationalities.
Greek and Roman deserters from the
armies of Alexander the Great and Pompey
fled to its fastnesses; Mongols found asylum
there, and Arabs, Jews, and later, Armenians.
All these peoples, to insure their security,
built their habitations in inaccessible
places. That they planned well was shown
by the way in which they held out against
both Turks and Persians. There is a saying
among the Persians, which has become a
proverb: “If the Shah becomes too proud,
let him make war with the highlanders of
Daghestan.”</p>

<p>Though the boys walked as rapidly as
possible in their anxiety to get away from
the village where they had been imprisoned,
night came while they were still up on the
top of the first high divide which they had
climbed after leaving the cañon. Away behind,
and far below them, was the slope
where they knew the village lay, though at<span class="pagenum">[158]</span>
that distance they could not make out the
houses.</p>

<p>The boys saw that they would be obliged
to pass the night on the summit, for while it
was still light where they were, down in the
cañon into which the trail descended it was
already dark. They looked about and found
a place where two or three great rocks
formed a protected angle, and there they
prepared to make their beds. That performance
was very simple, consisting only
of picking the loose stones from a space
large enough for them to lie down. Then
Sidney took their supper out of the knapsacks.</p>

<p>“Yum! yum!” said Raymond, as he
watched his brother take out the food;
“won’t that rabbit be good, though!”</p>

<p>Sidney paused and looked thoughtful for
a moment, then asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Is there anything you would specially
like for supper, Ray?”</p>

<p>“How about some caviare, like that we
had on the Volga steamer, and a cup of coffee;
yes, and a little butter.”</p>

<p>“What would you say to a glass of water?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[159]</span></p>

<p>Raymond looked thunderstruck. “For
Heaven’s sake, Sid! We haven’t any water,
have we?”</p>

<p>“I don’t find any here.” And Sidney
peered into the knapsack.</p>

<p>“What boneheads we are, Sid, and I was
hardly moistened through after that other
dry spell.” And Raymond groaned dismally.</p>

<p>“Well, I must say,” said Sidney, “I
should think water would be the last thing
we’d forget now. We can’t get down to the
bottom of that cañon to-night, either, and
there’s not likely to be any water this side
of the bottom.” And Sidney looked down
into the deep gloom of the ravine at their
feet.</p>

<p>“It’s a dry supper, that’s sure,” said
Raymond. “It’s a good thing that rabbit
has no salt.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, we’ll forget all about it once
we’re asleep, and we can hike down to the
next stream as soon as it’s light.” And Sidney
spread the meat, bread, and cheese out
on the ground before them.</p>

<p>“No cheese for yours truly, thank you,”
said Raymond, “but I’ll take some meat
and bread, if you please.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[160]</span></p>

<p>“I guess it would be wise to let the cheese
go by to-night,” agreed Sidney; “it’s a little
too salty for a dry lunch.”</p>

<p>“There’s one thing sure, Sid; we’ve got
to scare up something to carry water in.
We may be caught like this often.”</p>

<p>“Meantime, we’ll have to stop where
there is water, if we make only half a day.”</p>

<p>The roast rabbit was savory enough to
assist the consumption of a little dry bread,
and the lack of water did not prevent the
boys from going to sleep almost as soon as
they lay down. Early to bed, the old jingle
truthfully says, is early to rise, and the boys
were awake before the sun had touched the
peaks around them, and while the cañons
were still in dense shadow.</p>

<p>It required only a minute or two for the
travelers to roll up their blankets and start
on their hike down into the next ravine. At
its bottom was a little stream that seemed,
to the thirsty boys, to be flowing nectar.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of that day they observed
a village, the first one, but as it was
perched up on the side of the ravine, and
they happened at that time to be in the
bottom, they passed stealthily, and thought<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>
themselves fortunate to get by. An hour or
two later, when they found that the trail
was leaving the cañon to climb another
mountain, they camped right there by the
stream, determined not to be surprised by
another dry camp.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="Page_162" class="pagenum">[162]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">LESGHIAN HOSPITALITY</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">The boys need not have been uneasy
about water, for as they advanced to
the main range every ravine was the bed of
a foaming torrent, and there were no more
dry camps. The trail crossed the streams by
bridges of curious construction. Sometimes
the bridge spanned a gorge high above the
stream, and sometimes it was thrown across
from banks that were near the water.</p>

<p>To build the bridges logs were projected a
few feet from one side, being held in place
by an abutment of rocks which was built
about them and in which they were bedded.
Above those logs were laid other longer ones
which projected a few feet farther, and were
lashed to the lower ones by leather thongs,
secured at the inner end by the rock abutment.
That was repeated until from each
side extended a span so far out that finally
the intervening space could be covered by a
length of poles. Then a hand-rail was placed<span class="pagenum">[163]</span>
along each side, and the result was a rude
but stable and safe suspension bridge.</p>

<p>The bridges were a never-failing source
of interest and wonder to the boys. Each
one that they crossed seemed quite as remarkable
as the first one had appeared, and
they always stopped to look in admiration.
Days afterward, in Batum, when they were
describing their mountain journey to an
English-speaking Russian, they were told
that in all the mountain region the building
of bridges was so difficult that the destruction
of one was punished by death.</p>

<p>Raymond shot another rabbit, which
eked out their scanty stock of bread and
cheese for a couple of days. Then, as the
food was almost gone, they decided they
must stop at the first village they came to.
That they found situated high on a mountain-side.
Though they had sighted the
houses early in the afternoon, the climb up
to them was so steep and so long that night
was closing in when they arrived.</p>

<p>That village, like the one from which they
had escaped, was built in terraces on a
mountain slope, but it was much steeper,
even, than the first village. The road went<span class="pagenum">[164]</span>
up in front of the lower tier of houses, where
were standing several men, who, apparently,
had been watching the boys’ approach.</p>

<p>Sidney selected the most important-looking
of the group and tendered him their
passport, with an inquiry for accommodation
for the night. The man received the
paper, examined it curiously, and then
passed it on to another near him. It went
around the circle, and was the subject of
an animated conversation, coming back in
the end to Sidney, with, however, no intelligible
comment.</p>

<p>“Can you tell us where we will find supper
and lodging?” Sidney asked.</p>

<p>The man who had received the paper
looked mystified and replied in a tongue
that sounded to the boys different from
anything they had previously heard: as indeed
it was, for in the mountainous part of
Daghestan nearly every village has its own
dialect, there being about twenty different
languages spoken in that area.</p>

<p>“It’s no use to talk to them, Sid,” said
Raymond; “they won’t understand a word
you say.”</p>

<p>“I know they won’t, but I can’t just<span class="pagenum">[165]</span>
stand and stare at them. It’s much easier
to say something, even if they don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to use pantomine, the way
Ramon used to with the Tarahumaras.
Let’s see what I can do.” And Raymond
made the motion of putting something into
his mouth, at the same time working his
jaws vigorously.</p>

<p>The man laughed, as did all the others.
The number present had been increased by
many who were curious to see the strangers,
and laughter and joking remarks extended
through the crowd.</p>

<p>Raymond’s face grew very red. “They
are easily amused,” he said sarcastically,
“but I’ll bet they understood what I
meant.”</p>

<p>It was apparent that they did understand,
for the man who had been addressed beckoned
to the boys to follow him, and proceeded
to a near-by house. As they were
about to enter, something over the door
caught Raymond’s eye, and he stopped and
stared incredulously.</p>

<p>“Goodness! Sid, look over the door!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[166]</span></p>

<p>On the lintel were tacked the bony skeletons
of two human hands.</p>

<p>“That looks pretty gruesome,” said Sidney;
“I wonder what it means.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s a pleasant reminder of
some nice feud. We’d better not show too
much interest in it; they might not like
that.”</p>

<p>The room that they entered had a floor
that was earth mixed with chopped straw
packed down hard and smooth. It was
quite dark, being lighted only by the door
and two small portholes of windows that
had neither sash nor glass. Supper, which
consisted of a kettle of stewed mutton, was
just ready, and was placed on the floor in
the center of the room. The family gathered
about the kettle, each person provided with
a sharp stick with which he fished out fragments
of meat. They also dipped pieces of
black bread in the broth, and soaked them
before they were eaten. The boys were
given sticks and helped themselves as the
others did, finding the stew extremely savory.</p>

<p>When supper was finished there was the
sound of a fife outside, and the family all
got up and went out, followed by the boys.<span class="pagenum">[167]</span>
They found a large gathering of people,
with torches placed around on the buildings
for light. The fife was playing shrilly,
and as a drum began to mark time, a man
stepped out into a space that had been left
in the center. Then a woman from another
side joined him and they danced in a stately
fashion. The fife and the drum vied with
each other in the noise they made, and frequently,
as the couple danced, there was a
fusillade of pistol shots, fired by the spectators.</p>

<p>Presently, when those dancers had become
weary, they retired and their places
were taken by others, who danced in the
same fashion, to the same accompaniment
of pistol shots added to the music of the fife
and drum. Besides the circle of people surrounding
the dancers, many others were
perched on the flat-topped roofs of the near-by
houses.</p>

<p>It was well into the night before the dancing
ceased and the people scattered to their
homes. The boys went with their host, who
indicated some rugs on the floor where they
might spread their beds. The rugs were
fine, silky, and delightfully soft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[168]</span></p>

<p>“Gee! Sid,”&mdash;and Raymond stooped to
examine the beautiful rug before placing
his blankets on it,&mdash;“if mother was here
I’ll bet that rug would go with her when
she left, if she had to carry it herself.”</p>

<p>“She’d just go wild over them, Ray.
They’re finer than anything she’s got.”</p>

<p>“Heck! Sid, why can’t we buy one to
take home to her?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it would be pretty heavy to
pack, with the load we’ve already got,”
said Sidney doubtfully. “I’d just love to
do it, though, it would please her so.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t got much of a load, Sid,
and these rugs are not heavy, they’re so fine
and thin. And one would be as good as another
blanket. We ought to have more bedding,
anyway, as we go higher up.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll see in the morning if we can
strike a bargain with that fellow. I’ve got
to get to sleep now, I’m dead tired. I’m
glad we don’t have a dance every night.”</p>

<p>In the morning, when the boys had eaten
and wished to depart, Sidney took a piece
of bread, and opening their knapsacks,
showed that they contained no food, at the
same time holding the bread up inquiringly.<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>
Their host understood at once that they
wished to buy food, and brought two or
three loaves of black bread. Then Sidney
held four rubles out on his open hand, motioning
toward their beds to indicate that
he wished to include that accommodation
as well as the food. The man took two
rubles from the four, and bowed in assent.</p>

<p>There still remained the rug which the
boys wished to buy, and Sidney picked up
the finer of the two pieces of carpet and
held it up, saying, “How much?”</p>

<p>The man considered for a few moments,
and held a short consultation with his wife,
after which he extended his hands with the
fingers all open.</p>

<p>“He means ten rubles, Sid,” said Raymond.
“That’s dirt cheap.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is, and I guess we’d better
take it.” Whereupon Sidney nodded in
affirmation and took out his purse for the
money. “I hope I’ve got enough here without
going down under my clothes.”</p>

<p>“If you haven’t, I have a few rubles in
my purse.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I have exactly ten rubles. When
we’re out on the trail, Ray, you must remind<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>
me to take some more money from my
secret stock.”</p>

<p>“Now I’ll take your cloak, Sid,” said
Raymond, “and carry it with my cloak and
blanket. Then you take the rug with your
blanket, and that will be about even. Gee!
won’t mother be pleased with that rug!
And you certainly are a peach, Sid, with
sign language.”</p>

<p>“I feel silly as can be when I try to talk
without saying anything. I wish we were in
Mexico, or some other place where we could
use Spanish.”</p>

<p>When the boys started out they were
obliged to drop down to the bottom of the
cañon again to pick up the trail. Then began
the really difficult part of their mountain
journey. For several days they climbed
steep slopes by endless zigzags, or trod the
edges of dizzy precipices. The cañons were
deep, dark, and narrow, and occurred one
right after another, with no intervening
level ground. The boys were always either
straining forward to toil up a precipitous
ascent, or holding back to keep from pitching
down another. And always when they
opened their bed under some sheltering<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>
rock they were at a higher elevation than on
the previous night. That meant, as a general
thing, that each camp was colder than
the preceding one.</p>

<p>The camps soon became very cold indeed,
and the boys were obliged each night
to seek a spot that was protected from the
biting winds that raced and surged from the
crests above. As soon as the sun was gone,
the cold air descended from the summits to
take the place of the layers that rose from
the rocks which had been warmed during
the day.</p>

<p>The lower portions of the range had been
destitute of trees, but between that section
and the heights that were above the timber
line was a zone where a little timber grew.
When the boys reached that belt they also
ran into clouds and drizzling mists.</p>

<p>One day the weather had been threatening
and damp, but not actually raining.
Toward night, however, the clouds thickened
and descended in genuine rain. The
boys saw that they would soon be soaked
through, their beds as well as their clothes.
That would mean a night of misery, so they
hunted for a spot that was sheltered from<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>
the storm. Fortune smiled on them, for almost
immediately Sidney, who had gone a
little to one side of the trail to examine a
ledge of rocks for possible shelter, called out
to his brother,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Here’s a dandy place, Ray.”</p>

<p>In the face of the ledge was a narrow fissure
which was just wide enough, with some
squeezing, to admit the boys. Once inside,
however, the opening proved to be a good-sized
cave. The ceiling was high enough
for the boys to stand upright, and there was
plenty of room for them to spread their beds
comfortably. Moreover, it was absolutely
dry, and there was a thick coating of fine
soil on the floor which would make a soft bed.</p>

<p>“This is swell, Sid,” exclaimed Raymond,
when they were inside. “Jiminy! it’s good
to be out of the rain. Just see how it’s coming
down now.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Sidney, “it’s raining so
hard that we shan’t be able to get any wood
for a fire.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, it’s warm in here, and we have
nothing to cook anyway. I think there’s a
little meat left, and there’s always that horrid
bread.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[173]</span></p>

<p>Raymond had succeeded in keeping them
supplied with small game. The day before
he had shot two fine grouse, and there was
still some of that meat. The boys ate their
cold supper and spread their beds before it
became dark, then sat in the gloom talking.
Night fell rapidly, and with the heavy
downpour of rain it soon became very dark.
The boys were just about to roll up in their
blankets for the night when they heard
strange noises outside. There was a low,
muttered grumbling, mingled with a strange
whimpering.</p>

<p>The boys sat breathless, listening intently.
At first they thought it must be
some large animal, though they had seen
no animals larger than rabbits. In a moment,
however, the voice whimpered complainingly,
and the boys thought it was
surely a person in distress. The storm was
turning colder, and the rain and sleet were
coming down in such volumes that any one
caught in it, perhaps insufficiently clothed,
would suffer greatly.</p>

<p>Raymond was about to step to the opening
and call out that there was shelter near,
when the whimpering ceased and the growling<span class="pagenum">[174]</span>
began again, in a heavier, gruffer tone
than at first. It was plain that it could not
be a human being that made such noises,
and it seemed to the frightened boys that it
must be a very large animal.</p>

<p>“What can it be, Sid?” whispered Raymond.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, unless it’s a wolf. We’ve
read of the terrible Russian wolves.”</p>

<p>“The animal that’s growling like that is
bigger than a wolf,” declared Raymond.</p>

<p>“Then I hope it’s so big that it can’t
squeeze in here.”</p>

<p>The growling and muttering continued,
and steadily drew nearer. The boys sat
shivering. The cave had grown much
colder, they thought, and their teeth chattered.
Suddenly the noises ceased and there
was a dreadful silence. The rain was still
pouring outside, with a steady roar on the
rocks, but the boys did not notice that, and
it seemed to them that all sounds had
stopped.</p>

<p>Silently the two sat in suspense, wondering
what would happen, whether they would
suddenly be conscious of an animal in the
cave with them. Then they reflected that<span class="pagenum">[175]</span>
the entrance was so small that no large animal
could pass through, at least not quickly.</p>

<p>They were gazing intently toward the
opening, though the darkness was so dense
that not even its outline could be distinguished.
As they sat, rigid, they realized
with a shock that they were looking at two
small balls of fire which must be just outside
the opening. The fiery globes remained
stationary, and colder shivers ran along the
boys’ spines.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A BLOCKADE</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">When the boys saw the two glowing
spots of fire in the entrance to the
cave, for one sickening moment they imagined
that it was something supernatural.
They waited tensely for whatever fearful
development might follow.</p>

<p>“What can it be, Sid?” And Raymond’s
voice trembled.</p>

<p>“It’s beyond me. Is it outside, or in?”</p>

<p>As they gazed, the glowing orbs rose
slowly to about the height of a man, where
they again remained stationary. There was
a rock wall a short distance in front of the
cave so that no sky-line could be visible
from the entrance. Consequently, in the
pitch darkness there was not the slightest
suggestion of a form that could be distinguished.
It was as though the luminous
points had raised independent of any
agency. But the fact of their rising to the
height at which they stopped suggested a<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>
possibility to Sidney, and he exclaimed
under his breath,&mdash;</p>

<p>“It must be a bear, Ray, and he’s risen
to his hind legs.”</p>

<p>“Gee! I believe it is, and those are his
eyes.”</p>

<p>“But don’t shoot, you would only wound
him.”</p>

<p>Sidney’s warning was too late, for as he
spoke Raymond fired. The glowing balls
wavered, rapidly disappearing and reappearing
several times, then became extinguished.
At the same time there was the
sound of scratching and straining, with
groaning and grunting. Then there was a
cough or two and all was quiet.</p>

<p>The boys waited with their hearts in
their throats, expecting an attack from some
sort of formidable animal. But the silence
continued.</p>

<p>“You certainly hit him, Ray,” said Sidney.</p>

<p>“Yes, but why didn’t he drop?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you didn’t kill him.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t he run away, or attack
us? And why is he so still now?”</p>

<p>“I give it up,” said Sidney. “I wish I
could see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[178]</span></p>

<p>“I’m going to strike a match,” declared
Raymond, “and find out what I did do.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sidney, rather dubiously, “I
suppose that will do no harm. If he wants to
rush us he won’t wait for a light.”</p>

<p>The match burned dimly and the boys
strained their eyes to solve the mystery
held by the darkness. Then the blaze flared
up brightly, and there, erect in the entrance,
loomed a huge bulk which the boys could
not see well enough to identify.</p>

<p>Raymond smothered an exclamation when
he saw it, but before either of them could
determine what it was, the light died down
and they were again left in darkness.</p>

<p>The monster had seemed to be just crowding
through the opening, which he completely
filled, and the apparition had appeared
so lifelike that the boys expected an
immediate onslaught. They were appalled
by the size of the intruder, and in their
cramped quarters only one result seemed
possible. Still there was no advance by the
strange animal, and the silence was still
profound.</p>

<p>“If that is a bear,” whispered Sidney,
“why doesn’t he do something?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[179]</span></p>

<p>“We might as well be killed as scared to
death in this way; I’m going to strike
another match.”</p>

<p><a id="Ref_179a" href="#Ref_179">Raymond took a cautious step toward the
entrance</a> and lighted a match. The anxious
boys thought the blaze would never stop
sputtering and burn clear and bright. When
it did, Raymond held it up as close as he
dared and saw a great bear standing erect
on his hind legs, apparently wedged tightly
in the opening. The animal’s head lay over
to one side against the rock, and blood
dripped from the jaws.</p>

<div id="Ref_179" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i178.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><a href="#Ref_179a">RAYMOND TOOK A CAUTIOUS STEP TOWARD THE ENTRANCE</a></p></div>
</div>

<p>“He’s dead!” exclaimed Raymond. “He
must have been just squeezing through
when I fired into his mouth and killed him,
and he was wedged in too tight to fall.”</p>

<p>“For Heaven’s sake, Ray, think what
would have happened if you had done as I
said and not fired!”</p>

<p>“Well, I did fire, and nothing happened.
But wasn’t that a lucky shot?”</p>

<p>“You always do just what you want to
with a gun, Ray, whether it’s light or
dark.”</p>

<p>“Oh, this was a chance shot, of course, for
I couldn’t see a thing but his eyes. It’s<span class="pagenum">[180]</span>
mighty strange that his eyes shone so when
it’s so dark.”</p>

<p>“The rock at the back of the cave is
white,” said Sidney, “and it must reflect a
little light. He could probably see us, though
we couldn’t see him.”</p>

<p>“I move we get to bed,” said Raymond;
“such scares make me awfully tired.”</p>

<p>“And leave that fellow standing in the
door?”</p>

<p>“Why not? He can’t hurt us now.”</p>

<p>“No, I guess he’s past that. Well, I’m
tired, too, and I’ll beat you to bed.”</p>

<p>In less than a minute the boys had pulled
off their shoes and crawled into their blankets,
and in another minute they were asleep.
Their excited, turbulent life of the previous
few weeks, and the great fatigue they underwent
at times, had put them in good
training to sleep promptly. An opportunity
was all they needed, and they immediately
became oblivious to all their worries.</p>

<p>When the boys woke in the morning and
saw the light peering around the huge form
that was still jammed in the entrance, the
sight was rather startling. A moment’s reflection,
however, recalled the events of the<span class="pagenum">[181]</span>
previous evening, and alarm became curiosity.
They found that the bear would undoubtedly
have succeeded in passing the
entrance had he not been killed in the nick
of time. While his body was a tight fit in the
opening, it was really held upright, after the
fatal shot, mainly by projections of the unequal
rocky sides. He was, however, quite
as big as he had appeared in the dim
light.</p>

<p>When Raymond fired, the bullet, as he
had surmised the night before, had entered
the bear’s mouth, which probably had been
open, and had, undoubtedly, penetrated the
brain, causing instant death. The boys
pushed and lifted on the carcass until they
succeeded in crowding it out sufficiently to
let it fall to the ground, where it lay just
outside the entrance.</p>

<p>“Gee, but he’s a whopper!” exclaimed
Raymond, as they stood looking down at the
prostrate animal.</p>

<p>“He would have made things lively for
us,” said Sidney, “if he had once got inside.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but he didn’t get inside, thanks to
this little pet of mine.” And Raymond
patted his revolver approvingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[182]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, Ray; I’m going to
sharpen my knife on a rock and see if I can’t
cut out some steaks.”</p>

<p>“That will be swell!” agreed Raymond.</p>

<p>Sidney found it was not easy to put an
edge on a knife with only a piece of rock for
a whetstone. The beast’s hide, too, was extremely
tough. He finally, however, succeeded
in laying the skin back enough to cut
two or three fine steaks.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased in the night, and
morning had come clear and cold. While
Sidney was struggling with the meat, Raymond
gathered wood and built a fire. By
the time the steaks were ready there was a
fine bed of coals to broil them, and the boys
were soon eating a savory breakfast.</p>

<p>“It’s a shame to leave that fine pelt here,”
said Raymond, looking from the steak he
was consuming over to its source.</p>

<p>“Yes, it is,” assented Sidney, “but, of
course, we can’t do anything with it. If we
had it in El Paso, though, it would pay a
passage home for both of us.”</p>

<p>“I guess it would,” sighed Raymond;
“and to think we’ve got to let it lie here!
It’s the first bear I ever shot, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[183]</span></p>

<p>“And you shot him blindfolded. I don’t
see how you managed to do it.”</p>

<p>“Well, I aimed just a little below his eyes.
I intended to shoot him in the head, but I’d
forgotten a bear’s snout is so pointed. If the
bullet hadn’t struck him in the mouth, just
by a chance, it wouldn’t have killed him.”</p>

<p>“I wish father was here to have some of
this meat,” said Sidney; “you know he’s
awfully fond of bear steak.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Raymond, “I wish we
knew where he is; it makes me homesick to
think about him.”</p>

<p>“I guess mother will never let us go away
from home again,” said Sidney, “after we
get back this time.”</p>

<p>“<em>If</em> we get back this time, you mean.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get back all right, Ray, and
don’t you forget it.”</p>

<p>“I certainly shan’t, if we get there.”</p>

<p>It had taken the boys a good while to prepare
the steaks and cook them, so by the
time they had finished their breakfast it was
later than they usually took the road. They
hurried off, therefore, with a last regretful
look at the fine skin which they were obliged
to leave behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[184]</span></p>

<p>The elevation had been rapidly increasing
and the mountains had become rockier and
more precipitous. The sleet which fell the
night they were in the cave was the first
frozen rain they had encountered, but the
snow-covered heights had even before that
sometimes seemed very near.</p>

<p>The night after the boys’ adventure with
the bear was very cold and they searched
for another cave, but unsuccessfully. They
found, however, a crevice in the rocks that
was large enough for them to crawl into.
They could not lie down, but they huddled
up close together in their blankets and were
warmer than they would have been outside.</p>

<p>The next night the boys found shelter in
the mountain village of Bezheeta, which
perched at an elevation of about nine thousand
feet. The warmth of the rude stone
house in which they slept was very pleasant
after the exposure of the previous nights.
Bezheeta is at the foot of the ultimate great
ridge which forms the backbone of the
Caucasus Range. The snowy summits towered
some three thousand feet above the
village, and appeared to the weary boys an
almost insurmountable barrier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[185]</span></p>

<p>There was no dance that night as there had
been at the other village where they stopped.
The night air was too frosty for such an outdoor
function. Consequently the boys were
allowed to get to sleep early, and were up
correspondingly early in the morning. That
enabled them to start out on their last climb
long before the sun appeared over the mountain
crests.</p>

<p>The trail went up the steep ascent by a
switchback which crossed, back and forth,
the bed of a foaming stream that came down
from a glacier above. At first the walking
was good, over hard rock, but presently
they reached snow, and tramped for a time
through half-frozen slush. That greatly increased
the effort necessary to climb the
steep trail. The boys slipped and slid, and it
sometimes seemed to them that they hardly
advanced at all. Their feet became soaked
and cold, and altogether they felt very miserable
and discouraged.</p>

<p>Then gradually the slush underfoot became
firmer and changed to old snow that
was packed and frozen hard. Finally the
noise of the torrent ceased; that, too, was
frozen. Still, up, up, the boys toiled, their<span class="pagenum">[186]</span>
packs growing heavier and their breath
shorter.</p>

<p>As the day advanced, clouds gathered
about the summits, and from these masses
snow-squalls swept down across the ravines
and ridges. Several of these surging gusts
enveloped the boys. At first the flurries of
snow were light and rather fun than otherwise,
but as the boys gained in altitude the
storms increased in density and in severity.
Finally, when one came they did not try to
breast it, but stopped, in the shelter of some
rock if possible, till it passed.</p>

<p>Occasionally there was a heavy noise like
rolling thunder that echoed from cliff to cliff.
The boys thought it very strange that there
should be thunder with what was, in effect,
a midwinter storm. Also there was no
lightning, only the reverberating noise, but
they could think of no other cause, and accepted
the thunder theory as the only one.</p>

<p>Then the perplexing question was solved
in a startling manner. The boys were toiling
up the steep side of a ravine, with the slopes
above them more nearly perpendicular than
where they were. A storm, which appeared
to be heavier than any previous one, passed<span class="pagenum">[187]</span>
along the mountain, extending beyond the
boys, and nearly smothering them in swirling
snow.</p>

<p>When the gust had gone by, just as they
were able to see once more, there was a roar
directly above them. They looked up and
saw what appeared to be the whole mountain-side
sweeping down upon them.</p>

<p>“It’s an avalanche, Ray!” cried Sidney;
“run to one side.”</p>

<p>The boys ran back on the trail to the first
angle, then plunged off into the snow,
floundering along in frantic haste. They had
time, however, to take only a few steps
when the great mass of snow was upon them.
With it were carried rocks and brush, whatever
the torrent had been able to tear from
the mountain.</p>

<p>When the boys saw that they could not
escape, and were about to be overwhelmed,
they seized hold of a small scrub tree that
was growing from a cleft in the rock, and
hung on for life.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="Page_188" class="pagenum">[188]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">SNOWED UNDER</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">When the boys clung to the tree in
the direct path of the avalanche,
their action was the instinctive effort toward
self-preservation, for they did not really
hope it would save them. The mass of snow
that was advancing upon them appeared to
be carrying everything before it, and they
fully expected, in the moment they had for
thought, to be added to that accumulation
of débris.</p>

<p>The great bulk, coming down with such
terrifying velocity, reached them and piled
over them, but not with the resistless force
they were braced to meet. The main body
of the avalanche passed with a roar just beyond,
and plunged into the cañon below.
The boys had paused in the edge of the torrent,
where its velocity was slight as compared
with that of the center. They crawled
out of the snow that covered them and
looked at each other with wide eyes.</p>

<p>“I can’t think of anything that could be<span class="pagenum">[189]</span>
worse than an avalanche,” said Raymond as
he looked down at the smooth path left by
the cataclysm.</p>

<p>“That was an awful moment,” said Sidney,
“just before it struck us.”</p>

<p>“I know I was never so badly scared before.
Do you suppose they are always as
thick as they have been to-day?”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so. I think when there is a
storm that the snow drifting in places is the
weight that starts the slide.”</p>

<p>“Well, I shan’t be easy a minute now,”
said Raymond, “till we’re at the top, and
that looks a long way off yet.”</p>

<p>“I guess we’d better not fool away any
time,” said Sidney, “and we’ve got no trail
to start with.”</p>

<p>The avalanche had descended diagonally
across the course of the trail, and had swept
away a long reach of it, leaving only a
smooth stretch of snow, with rocks sticking
up here and there. The portion of the trail
that was left intact was visible away up on
the mountain, and the boys started for it,
across the expanse of trackless snow. They
were obliged to go very carefully to prevent
slipping and sliding down the smooth incline.<span class="pagenum">[190]</span>
Their progress, therefore, seemed to
them distressingly slow, but they plodded
on persistently in their great desire to reach
the summit. Both were filled with a dread
of being caught in another avalanche, an
encounter that might not result so fortunately
as the first one had done.</p>

<p>At last the boys reached the unbroken
trail across the path of the avalanche. While
the road there had not been disturbed by
the slide, the storms that were increasing
with the increase of height had nearly buried
it in snow. Sometimes for many yards it
was entirely obliterated, and there the progress
of the travelers was still more painful
and slow. In such places they struggled
through the soft snow, at times sinking to
the waist before striking the hard old snow
beneath.</p>

<p>It was only by the utmost care and the
closest attention that the boys were able to
keep the course of the trail. Frequently they
lost it for a time, and then had to stop and
hunt carefully to find it again. They were
in constant terror lest they drop into some
unsuspected gulch, or slip over the concealed
edge of a ravine. It was a heart-breaking<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>
struggle and a slow one, and as they
toiled upward the difficulties increased.</p>

<p>Snow-squalls continued to sweep down
from the summits and along the slopes,
swirling about the laboring boys and blinding
them with the fine particles. At such
times they were obliged to stand still and
wait for the fury of the gust to pass. Then
they reached the glacier, which, early in the
day, they had seen above them. The trail
went up to the terminal moraine of the
glacier and disappeared, but the boys assumed
that it passed over the mass of broken
rocks to the ice. So they climbed over the
débris and up to the surface of the glacier,
which at that point was not very high. They
proceeded cautiously over the ice, until suddenly
they came to the edge of a crevice. So
unexpectedly, indeed, that Raymond nearly
plunged into it, and was only saved by Sidney,
who grasped him and threw him back
on the ice.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Raymond with a long breath,
as he rose to his feet; “that might be as bad
as an avalanche.”</p>

<p>“If you went down into it,” said Sidney,
“you would probably not have a very soft<span class="pagenum">[192]</span>
fall. We must have missed the road. I don’t
believe it comes up over a place like this.”</p>

<p>“No, it can’t. We’ll have to go back and
hunt for it. Jiminy! If we went over that
ice-field we’d run across polar bears next
time.”</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough bear for this trip,” declared
Sidney, as they turned back on their
tracks. “It’s a shame to lose this time, and
we’ve got to hustle to reach the top before
night.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe we can do it, Sid; I’m
about played out now.”</p>

<p>“We’ve simply got to do it. Let me carry
your blankets for a while, Ray.”</p>

<p>“Not much! I’ll carry them myself.”</p>

<p>The boys, on arriving again at the moraine,
after some search found that the trail turned
to the right, but was covered with fresh
snow, which was the cause of their missing
it. It followed along the side of the glacier
for a distance, and then over the ridge into a
smaller ravine that was not filled with ice.</p>

<p>While the next ravine was not the bed of a
glacier, it contained very much more snow.
At the height to which the boys had reached
by that time the storms during the day had<span class="pagenum">[193]</span>
been more frequent and more severe, consequently
there was a great deal of fresh
snow, which made traveling very much
more difficult.</p>

<p>At first the trail climbed along well up on
the left side of the ravine, and in that exposed
position it was not filled uniformly
with soft snow. In places the snow had
failed to lodge, or had been swept away by
eddying gusts, and those places came with
sufficient frequency to mark the road for the
travelers.</p>

<p>So, usually, while the boys were floundering
through a deep deposit of fresh snow,
they were able to see, ahead of them, the trail
where it passed over the old hard snow of
former years. In that way they were enabled
to keep the general direction of the
road, though they were sometimes off it, in
deeper snow than ever. At such times when
they left the trail, they frequently plunged
down into soft snow that was above their
waists, and were obliged to make a desperate
effort to get back on the hard foundation.</p>

<p>Such traveling would have been sufficiently
difficult if the boys had been unencumbered,
and with the packs they were<span class="pagenum">[194]</span>
carrying it was extremely exhausting. Once
or twice, when Raymond stepped off into
loose snow, he was obliged to wait for Sidney’s
help before he could get back. Sometimes,
when the boys sank down in that way,
they would loosen their blanket rolls, and
throw them up, thus being enabled to crawl
out without help.</p>

<p>All that occupied much time, besides taking
the strength of the struggling boys, and
the sun sank behind the western peaks and
they were still not out of that cañon. Then,
too, as they constantly climbed to higher
elevations, and the trail approached the
upper end of the ravine, it was less exposed
to the wind and was more evenly covered
with snow. So, finally, the boys labored
through deep snow without any intervals of
good road, and could only with difficulty
keep the trail at all.</p>

<p>For what seemed to the boys hours they
toiled on and up, without conversation, except
when one of them briefly requested aid
from the other. All their breath was needed
for the work they were doing, with none left
for talk. Sidney was a little taller than his
brother, and in deep snow that gave him<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>
great advantage. Then, being older, he was
more solid and more closely knit, consequently
he possessed greater endurance. So
it was generally his lot to pull Raymond out
of holes.</p>

<p>When they missed the road and got up
on the glacier by mistake, Raymond had
thought he was not equal to much more, but
with pure nerve he kept to the work, and for
a long time said nothing more about being
tired. At first the fear of another avalanche
had been an incentive to keep forging ahead.
As they ascended, however, and neared the
summit of the range, they gradually rose
level with, or above, the overhanging cliffs
from which snow-slides were likely to start,
and were relieved of that fear.</p>

<p>But there may be a limit to the endurance
of even a gritty boy, and Raymond began to
feel that he was really at the end of his rope.
The day had been extremely arduous, and it
had been preceded by many days of hard
work, with barely a sufficiency of food. The
boy finally stopped, standing in the deep
snow, and gazed up at the summit above
them.</p>

<p>The snow-squalls had ceased and the<span class="pagenum">[196]</span>
clouds had cleared away. The sun, which
was out of sight behind the western peaks,
still shone on the crests, and turned all
their white covering to a glorious rosy pink.
That beauty was lost on Raymond, however,
for all he could think of was the distance
that remained. It was not far,&mdash;indeed, it
seemed very near,&mdash;but every step was
through deep snow, and all vestige of a trail
had disappeared.</p>

<p>“Sid!” called Raymond to his brother,
who was a few steps ahead, and his voice
hardly carried the short distance.</p>

<p>Sidney stopped and looked back.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I can go any farther, Sid.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t stop here, Ray.”</p>

<p>“I know; I suppose if I stop it will be for
good. You go on without me, Sid. You can
make it alone, and there is no use in both of
us failing.”</p>

<p>Sidney returned to his brother, and was
alarmed by the pallor of the boy’s face.</p>

<p>“Give me your blankets, Ray,” he said;
“I ought to have taken them before.”</p>

<p>“You can’t carry mine and your own too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I can, easily.” And Sidney detached
the blanket roll from the shoulder of<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>
the unresisting boy. “Now, see, Ray, it’s
only a little bit farther; don’t you think you
can get up without anything to carry?”</p>

<p>“I’ll try; maybe I can.”</p>

<p>Raymond took one or two struggling, uncertain
steps in the deep snow and stopped
again.</p>

<p>“Here, Ray,” said Sidney, when he saw
how exhausted his brother was; “take hold
of the end of this blanket roll and pull just
as hard as you want to. That will help you
along.”</p>

<p>Raymond did as directed, taking hold of
the roll which was slung over Sidney’s
shoulder, and again they started. They took
two or three steps when Sidney felt the
weight released from his shoulder. He
looked back and saw that Raymond had
sunk down in the snow.</p>

<p>“Ray!” he said, but there was no response.</p>

<p>He stooped and raised Raymond’s head.
The boy’s face was very white and his eyes
were closed.</p>

<p>“Ray! Ray!” called Sidney beseechingly,
but Raymond did not hear, and when Sidney
released his head it dropped forward on
his chest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[198]</span></p>

<p>Sidney stood up and looked about him in
a panic. The setting sun still illumined the
summit that was so short a distance above
him. But everywhere between was deep
snow and no trail. If there were only a trail,
Sidney thought, he would take Raymond on
his back and carry him to the top. It would
be like a labor of Hercules, but he believed
he could do it. Without a trail, however,
and with deep snow to walk through, such a
thing was plainly impossible.</p>

<p>He looked down on Raymond, who lay in
the snow just as he had dropped, and realized
that if he did not do something promptly
the fainting boy would become so cold that
nothing could revive him. And yet, what
could he do? They had gone far above the
timber-line, and there was not a shrub or
tree in sight, nothing to make a fire for
warmth. And there was, apparently, no
refuge from the snow that covered all the
rocks, the snow that was likely to freeze
them both. That, then, would be the end of
their desperate attempt to reach home, and
their mother, who was waiting in New York,
and their father in a Russian prison, would
never know what had become of them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">AN ARCTIC CAMP</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">When Sidney looked around and
saw only a desolate Arctic waste,
with no haven from the bleak exposure, his
strength and courage suddenly went from
him and he sank down in the snow by his
brother’s side. The piercing cold remorselessly
bit through his clothes and sucked all
his vitality. But as he crouched in the snow,
the relief of repose was so great that he
thought, languidly, he would rest there with
Raymond, and escape the terrific struggle for
a time. He was rapidly becoming numbed
by the cold, and was lapsing into a somnolent
state that felt neither inconvenience
nor pain.</p>

<p>Then, with a mental wrench, Sidney’s
thoughts reverted to his brother’s condition,
and he remembered that when Raymond
fell he had determined that he must do
something immediately to restore him. That
thought gave to his brain the fillip that was
necessary to set his mind at work again, and<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>
he struggled to his feet and looked around at
Raymond. The sight of the boy, huddled
helplessly in the snow, brought a complete
realization of their peril, and he became once
more alert. By stamping his feet and threshing
his arms he restored a tingling circulation,
and began to feel equal to further
effort.</p>

<p>When Sidney examined his surroundings
more carefully than he had done in his first
fright, he saw, not far away, a break in a
snowy cliff. What had before appeared to
be only a bit of rock exposed through the
snow seemed then to promise a space back
of the white mantle. With careful steps he
waded over to the spot, and found, to his
joy, that there was really a shelter ready
for them. A shelving cliff projected a few
feet beyond its base, and that projection had
prevented the snow from drifting in quite to
the rock at the bottom. There was a space
of bare ground some three or four feet wide,
and, what was more important, there were
small shrubs growing all along at the base of
the cliff.</p>

<p>With a renewal of energy Sidney returned
to his brother, taking care to step in the<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>
tracks he had made when going to the cliff.
By so doing he packed the snow to some extent
and made a semblance of a trail. Raymond
had not stirred, and Sidney thought,
with a pang, that without effective aid he
probably never would stir again. He picked
the unconscious boy up, and holding him
across one shoulder, retraced his steps to the
cliff.</p>

<p>Sidney laid his brother down on the bare
ground close to the rock wall, and then,
without waiting to revive him, he hurried to
collect fuel before it should become quite
dark. Fortunately, while the shrubs at the
base of the cliff appeared small, they had
been growing for many years and there was
more dead wood than green. Gathering
armfuls of the small dead branches Sidney
built a fire at the edge of the snow in front of
where Raymond lay.</p>

<p>How grateful was the warmth that was
thrown back from the rocks of the cliff! The
ruddy fire, reflected brilliantly from the
glistening snow that covered everything,
changed the appearance of cold, which had
been so depressing but a few moments before,
to a seeming of cheer and hope. Even<span class="pagenum">[202]</span>
the sight of Raymond, lying so still between
the fire and the cliff, seemed less dreadful.</p>

<p>As soon as the fire was established, Sidney
placed a supply of fuel within reach, and
then turned his attention to Raymond.
Opening the blankets, and spreading the
warm Daghestan rug on the ground, he
stretched his brother on that. Then he
took off Raymond’s shoes and stockings,
and after briskly chafing his ice-cold feet,
wrapped them in a blanket and chafed his
hands and wrists. Alternately rubbing the
boy’s feet and hands, he worked assiduously
until a slight degree of warmth began to be
manifest.</p>

<p>Sidney kept the fire replenished, maintaining
a constant brisk though small
blaze. In the restricted quarters the heat
was given back from wall and sloping ceiling
until it was almost like a warm room. Sidney’s
own exertions, quite independent of
the fire, put his whole body in a most agreeable
glow, but he was becoming fatigued
and hungry almost to the limit of endurance.
Finally, as he had used his entire stock of
fuel, he went along the base of the cliff to
search for more, first covering Raymond<span class="pagenum">[203]</span>
with the blankets. As he returned with an
armful of sticks he saw that his brother’s
eyes were open.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ray,” he cried cheerily; “how’s
this for a camp!”</p>

<p>Raymond smiled faintly and whispered,
“Gee, but I’m tired!”</p>

<p>“You have a right to be tired,” said Sidney,
“and there’s nothing to do now but
rest.”</p>

<p>“It’s fine to have nothing to do,” said
Raymond from his bed.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?” responded Sidney, though at
the time he was so tired he could hardly
stand.</p>

<p>“I think now,” he continued, “I’ll sit
down and have some supper. Don’t you
want something to eat, Ray?”</p>

<p>“I’m too tired to eat, and too warm to
move, but you go ahead, I’ll eat something
after a while.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad you’re warm, Ray,” said Sidney
as he opened a knapsack and took out
some food, “for you certainly were not an
hour ago.”</p>

<p>Raymond lay quiet, as if thinking, for a
moment, then he raised himself on his elbow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[204]</span></p>

<p>“Heck! Sid,” he exclaimed; “did you
bring me in here? I remember now I was
out in the snow, and thought I couldn’t go
any farther.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and you were a mighty heavy tug.
It was lucky you gave out when you did,
though, Ray, within reach of this fine place.”</p>

<p>“You certainly are a trump, Sid; you always
pull me through.”</p>

<p>“Well, now you’d better have some supper;
I know you’re hungry.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am hungry, and seeing you eat
makes me hungrier. Jiminy! Wouldn’t it
be swell to have some hot coffee?”</p>

<p>“It would that,” replied Sidney. “But
never mind, we’ll get where there’s coffee
before long.”</p>

<p>At Bezheeta they had obtained bread and
a little cheese, the latter being a great treat,
for they had been some days without any.
The bear steaks had been consumed before
they reached the village. They sat on their
blankets back of the little fire and ate the
bread and cheese with great relish. For
drink, of which they did not care for much,
they melted fresh snow in the cup.</p>

<p>As the boys sat munching their supper<span class="pagenum">[205]</span>
they looked out on a very Arctic landscape.
They were at the upper end of the ravine
they had been following up, and only a short
distance from the summit, with an outlook
that would, in daylight, embrace many
miles of the north side of the range. The sky
had cleared after the storms of the day, and
a full moon, just above the crests in the east,
flooded with a soft light the rocky cliffs and
ravines that were rounded with their covering
of white.</p>

<p>The overhanging cliff which formed the
boys’ shelter was draped from its upper edge
with frozen snow, which even hung down in
front and gave the appearance of an ice
grotto. The only relief from the prevailing
white radiance was afforded by the bare rock
of the cliff at the back. Even that was
picked out in ruddy lights reflected from
the fire.</p>

<p>That fire was the saving feature of the
whole scene. Outside, the prospect was one
of Arctic desolation, but inside, the impression
given by the cheerful blaze was one of
comfort and warmth.</p>

<p>The boys soon imbibed the cheer of their
immediate surroundings, and were promptly<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>
fortified by their supper. Both of them had
been exhausted as much by hunger as by
hard work. Not until they were lying at
their ease by the fire, and felt the rest that
is given by food, did they realize that they
had eaten nothing since they left Bezheeta
in the morning. The cold and bleakness of
the road had not invited lunches. The wonder
was that they had not given out before
they did.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t the trail covered up entirely
before we stopped, Sid?” asked Raymond
after they had finished their supper and lay
in the warmth.</p>

<p>“Yes, there wasn’t a foot of it left.”</p>

<p>“Do you think we can get up to the top
without any road?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I think so. It isn’t far, and it will
look mighty near in the morning.”</p>

<p>“But the snow is pretty deep,” said Raymond,
“and we’ll have to do some tall wading.
And suppose we drop into a hidden
gulch?”</p>

<p>“I think,” said Sidney, “that if we can
get up to the ridge back of this cliff we can
follow that up and the snow won’t be so
deep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[207]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I don’t want to be a croaker, Sid,
but what shall we do if we can’t find the
road down the other side?”</p>

<p>“I think when we get to the top that we’ll
find there is no snow on the other side, or
maybe just a little near the summit. It’s
too early in the season for the snow to go
very far down the south side of the range.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” said Raymond.
“That will be fine; I’m tired of
snow.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make quick time,” said Sidney,
“down the south side. As I remember the
map it’s a very short slope, compared with
this side.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” said Raymond, “I’ll be glad of
that. I want to get where I can eat a square
meal and have all the coffee I want. We
haven’t had a smell of coffee since we left
Petrovsk.”</p>

<p>“I hope, when we reach Tiflis,” said Sidney,
“that we can send a cable to mother. I
don’t know whether everything around the
Black Sea will be all war or not.”</p>

<p>“There’s one sure thing,” said Raymond;
“Russia can’t send any troops over these
mountains.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[208]</span></p>

<p>“Not by this trail, I guess,” said Sidney
with a laugh, “but she can send them up
through the Dariel Pass. You know they
told us at Petrovsk that troops were going
north that way then.”</p>

<p>“That was ages ago,” said Raymond.
“The war may have been ended long before
now.”</p>

<p>“It does seem a long time.” And Sidney
sighed wearily as he thought of the work
back of them. “I hope the war is over. I
wish we knew.”</p>

<p>The weather, after the skies cleared, had
turned cold very rapidly, and the night that
followed was very frosty, but the boys, in
what they called their house, were snug as
could be. The cliff served not only as a wall,
but as a roof, and with the fire in the “doorway,”
they were well protected. To be sure,
the fire did not burn all night, but they kept
it up until they were ready to crawl between
their blankets. Then they doubled up their
beds and slept close together, and though
the night was the coldest in all their camping
experience, they did not suffer.</p>

<p>In the morning it was a short task to
build a brisk fire with the stock of dry sticks<span class="pagenum">[209]</span>
they had left overnight. Indeed, the fire was
more cheerful than the breakfast, for with
a temperature that must have been hovering
near the zero mark, a cold, dry meal was
not very satisfying. Raymond sighed again
for hot coffee, and declared that if he ever
took such a journey again he would carry a
coffee-pot, whatever else he left behind.</p>

<p>The boys really felt very little effect from
the terrible exposure and fatigue of the previous
day. A night’s warm rest, and food
that was sufficient in quantity, however unpalatable
in quality, had restored them
completely. They started out, therefore,
with renewed courage, and, as Sidney had
predicted, the summit in the morning light
seemed very near, as though it were not
more than a few hundred yards away.</p>

<p>The boys first sought a place where they
might climb to the top of the cliff back of
their camp, and having gained that, found
they were on a ridge that led directly to the
summit. Even then, however, it was not an
easy climb. The snow, while not so deep as
it had been in the ravine, was still too deep
for good traveling. The more recently fallen
snow had been packed just enough to make<span class="pagenum">[210]</span>
it resist a little when they stepped on it, and
yet not enough to allow it to support their
weight. That made very heavy walking.</p>

<p>Over that yielding surface the boys
plodded slowly but steadily, and with good
cheer. The air was still and the sun shone
clear and warm. It was a day very different
from the previous one of storms. When they
stepped into a depression and were buried
to the waist, they did not mind it, but
laughed and struggled out.</p>

<p>In that way, slowly but surely, they won
toward the summit. As they neared the
goal their impatience increased until they
were ploughing through the snow with
breathless haste, panting and puffing with
the effort. Then, finally, they stood on the
topmost point, and simultaneously their
caps flew into the air, and they gave three
rousing cheers and a tiger.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">FROM MIDWINTER TO MIDSUMMER</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">For two or three weeks Sidney and
Raymond had had their gaze and
their hopes fixed on the summit of the Caucasus,
a soaring line that neared them, oh,
so slowly! They had toiled up, up, with
alternating courage and despondency. At
times the tremendous chasms which they
had been obliged to cross had given them
the disagreeable impression that they were
climbing for the sole purpose of descending
again. Always, however, when at the end
of a couple of days they took definite note
of results, they found there had been an
appreciable increase of elevation added to
their credit.</p>

<p>Sometimes they looked back and down on
the vicinity of a previous camp with such a
feeling of height gained that they were
elated. And again a day passed with hardly
any perceptible accomplishment. When,
therefore, they finally actually stood on the
summit, their delight was boundless. They<span class="pagenum">[212]</span>
shouted and jumped and capered on the
lonely crest as though they had taken leave
of their senses. One would have supposed
that their journey was finished and all the
hard work was done. To the casual observer,
though, there would have seemed to be still
something left.</p>

<p>The boys were standing on old, hardened
snow that had undoubtedly been in place
for many years, and that was pierced only
occasionally by rocks so gray as to be hardly
distinguishable from the dingy snow itself.</p>

<p>Back of them, by the route on which they
had come through Daghestan, the immediate
slopes were densely covered with snow,
but beyond, only the high elevations were
clothed in their first white robe of early fall.
The prospect that way was Arctic and forbidding.</p>

<p>In front of them, how different! At their
feet,&mdash;more than two miles of perpendicular
descent below them,&mdash;lay the great
valley of Georgia. It was crossed and
marked by scores of thread-like, glistening
lines, the streams and canals that carried
water over its fields and meadows. All was
glowing and smiling in the tints of summer,<span class="pagenum">[213]</span>
where even autumn, much less winter, had
not yet approached.</p>

<p>In the checkerboard of cultivated country
there were squares of dark, rich green that
indicated orange groves, and other divisions
of ashy green that proclaimed orchards of
olive trees. It was a glorious and beautiful
scene, and was like a fairy transformation
after the barren ranges and desolate slopes
of Daghestan.</p>

<p>Beyond that brilliant valley, as though to
remind the beholder that all to the south
was not soft and warm, towered the snow-capped
mountains of Armenia. In the west,
across a jumble of mountains that rose at
the upper end of the Georgian valley, the
boys saw a hazy line which they were sure
must be the Black Sea, and their hearts
throbbed faster as they looked.</p>

<p>The travelers were viewing the wonderful
panorama from a height of fully twelve
thousand feet, and only in the western portions
of the range were points that were
higher. To the east the range dropped much
lower, and when the boys turned that way
they saw, off on the dim horizon, a level line
that was, without doubt, the Caspian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[214]</span></p>

<p>“Gee! Sid,” exclaimed Raymond as they
gazed in wonder, “I thought I had been on
mountains before, but this beats everything.”</p>

<p>“And such a difference!&mdash;the dead of
winter on one side, and the middle of summer
on the other.”</p>

<p>“No wonder we were cold back there,”
said Raymond, as he looked over the snowy
wastes through which they had passed. “But,
jiminy, won’t I be glad to get down on that
side!” And he turned with longing to the
warmth and beauty of the south.</p>

<p>“It will be a short job to get down,” said
Sidney; “it’s almost a straight drop.”</p>

<p>“How about the trail?” suggested Raymond;
“there certainly is none in sight here.”</p>

<p>When the boys looked down on the slope
immediately below them they saw, what
they had not before observed, in their enthusiasm
over the view, that the snow did
not descend more than half a mile on that
side. The trail across the summit was entirely
obliterated, at least, the boys could
find none; and for a short distance down the
south side also, none appeared. A little farther
down, however, the snow was melted<span class="pagenum">[215]</span>
along the line of the trail, leaving it plainly
visible, while on either side the ground was
covered thick. Beyond the snow, also, the
road could occasionally be seen where an
angle of it came out on some ridge.</p>

<p>“You see, Ray,” said Sidney, “it’s not
far to a good trail at any rate. We can go
down that ridge, and we’ll soon be out of the
deep snow.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and then we’ll be in slush.”</p>

<p>“Well, that won’t last long, either. And
I’d rather have a little slush than much of
such work as we had this morning.”</p>

<p>“Heck! Sid,” said Raymond, “I hope
that country down there will be like western
Texas in the winter, with no rain.”</p>

<p>“Remember,” said Sidney, “that western
Texas sometimes has northers, and they’re
worse than rain.”</p>

<p>“I’ll guarantee there’ll be no northers
down there,” declared Raymond. “It would
take a pretty vigorous norther to get over
these mountains.”</p>

<p>“Well, once we’re down, we shan’t wait
for one; we’ll hike right on to Tiflis and the
railroad. It seems as though we ought
almost to see Tiflis from here.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[216]</span></p>

<p>“I’ll bet we could if we had glasses. Gee!
wouldn’t it be swell to have a pair of prism
binoculars? We could see everything from
the Black Sea to the Caspian, and the other
way to Nizhni.”</p>

<p>“They would be good ones.” And Sidney
laughed. “But we don’t want to take it all
out in looking. It must be about noon; suppose
we eat a lunch and then start down.”</p>

<p>“No more lunches in the snow for me,”
declared Raymond. “I’ll take my next
lunch on <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra firma</i>.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Sidney; “then we’d
better get a move on.”</p>

<p>Without stopping to hunt any longer for a
trail over the top, the boys started down a
ridge that appeared to intersect the road
below. At first the snow was deep, and the
traveling was bad, but the sun was warm
and the air was still, and soon, as Raymond
had predicted, they were in slush. That did
not last long, but it was followed by a zone
of mud. That, too, was soon past, and by
the time the travelers reached the road, they
were walking on dry ground.</p>

<p>With exclamations of delight the boys
threw themselves down in the warm sun,<span class="pagenum">[217]</span>
and stretching out at full length, ate a dry
lunch with utmost relish. As soon as that
was concluded they took the road again,
with a desire to reach a level that would give
a decidedly warmer climate for their next
camp.</p>

<p>The trail went down the tremendous
mountain wall by a series of switchbacks.
There would be a long zigzag, consisting of
twelve or fifteen sharp angles, back and
forth down a steep face of rock; then the
trail would run off to one side across the
heads of half a dozen gullies that were transformed
below into deep and precipitous
ravines; or perhaps it would descend for a
distance at a less acute angle down the
backbone of a long ridge.</p>

<p>Nearly all the time, as the travelers descended,
they were enraptured with a view
of the magnificent panorama that was spread
out before them. With all their experience
of mountain travel they had never before
seen anything to equal it. If they had ever
crossed the Alps in early spring from Switzerland
to Italy, they would have been supplied
with a comparison, though the prospect
before them was much grander and<span class="pagenum">[218]</span>
more extended than that afforded by the
journey down the Alps.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said Sidney, as they were
trotting down a zigzag with nothing to obstruct
the view, “that those high mountains
in the distance must be in Asia.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be swell, Sid, to have topographic
maps of this country! Do you
think they have anything like our Geological
Survey maps?”</p>

<p>“That’s not likely, in a wild country like
this.”</p>

<p>“But we have maps of wild mountains.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that’s in the United States.”</p>

<p>“Where I wish we were, this minute,”
declared Raymond fervently.</p>

<p>“I believe we’ve done our hardest work,”
said Sidney, “so don’t get blue. Won’t it
be fine, though, to get aboard a train at
Tiflis!”</p>

<p>“The finest will be a steamer on the Black
Sea, and then home; think of that, Sid!”</p>

<p>“I hope Turkey is not mixed up in the
war. I have a sort of an idea that she controls
the Black Sea, and unless she has
joined Russia and England we may have
trouble in getting out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[219]</span></p>

<p>“What should we do, then?” asked Raymond.</p>

<p>“I don’t know, but I’m sure Americans
would be allowed through if anybody
would.”</p>

<p>By night the boys had descended so far
that the air was soft and warm, and they
did not need to seek a spot that was sheltered
from cold winds. They chose a level place
and spread their blankets in the open, with
only the blue sky overhead. It was very
different from their camp of the previous
night, and, indeed, as they lay on the ground
looking up at the twinkling stars, it did not
seem possible that such a transformation
could be reality and not a dream.</p>

<p>The boys, however, did not take much
time for star-gazing, and the aching of their
muscles all over their bodies assured them
that what they had gone through was no
dream. Their prodigious exertions of the
previous days culminated in overwhelming
fatigue, and they had hardly more than
lain down when sleep made them oblivious
of everything.</p>

<p>Sidney and Raymond had camped out so
much, and so rarely with anything more<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>
than blankets to place between them and
the earth, that they could sleep on any spot,
however hard. If their bed were free from
loose rocks they asked nothing more. Sleep,
such as they had that night, is a great restorer,
and in the morning the boys felt
equal to anything that might be ahead of
them.</p>

<p>The travelers observed no habitations
on the south slope of the range, and in fact
the descent was so short and so precipitous
that it would have been impossible for any
one to make a home there. Even the hardy
tribes who had established villages in the
almost inaccessible mountains of Daghestan
would not have had the temerity to attempt
a colony on the opposite slope of the Caucasus.</p>

<p>By noon of the next day, however, the
boys had reached the upper margin of the
beautiful valley of the Alazan: a valley
where the dwellers conducted water wherever
they pleased, and that was made luxuriant
by the stimulus of irrigation under a
warm sun. There the languid air of a semi-tropic
early autumn was laden with the fragrance
of ripening grapes. A luscious late<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>
crop of figs hung heavy on their stems, and
pomegranates had burst their rinds to show
the crimson kernels within.</p>

<p>In groves of glossy dark orange trees
golden globes gleamed amidst the rich foliage,
and the ashy green of the olives was set
thick with the black of ripened fruit. All
was luxurious warmth, abundance, and
peace, and seemed to the boys, after the
rugged, sterile mountains over which they
had toiled, to be a veritable Happy Valley.</p>

<p>The travelers found the people whom they
encountered to be very different from the
stern inhabitants of the rugged mountains
of Daghestan. Indeed, such a type would
have been impossible in the languorous air
of the Southern valley. The Georgians appeared
a mild, gentle folk, and much more
fair of face than their neighbors across the
mountain barrier.</p>

<p>It was easy to make the owners of the
gardens and groves understand that a purchase
of fruit was desired, and a delicious
variety was heaped before the boys in return
for the silver coin which Sidney tendered.
And how they did feast! Only one
who has been entirely without fruit and<span class="pagenum">[222]</span>
vegetables for many days could understand
what that abundance meant to the boys.
Besides, the semi-tropical fruits reminded
them of their own Southwestern home, and
created a longing of homesickness that was
painful in its intensity.</p>

<p>As it was easy to obtain food, so also there
was an open hospitality that made the
tramp of two or three days across to Tiflis
an enjoyment rather than a task. Possibly
the people were not more hospitable than
those of Daghestan, and it may be that the
soft air and beautiful surroundings lent to
them a seeming of suave courtesy. At any
rate, the boys thoroughly enjoyed that part
of their journey, and it was the first time
that they had felt real enjoyment.</p>

<p>While the valleys were filled with luxuriant
growth, fostered by the streams that
were conducted in canals over their surface,
the mountains were more forbidding, and
that condition, also, reminded the boys of
their own Southwest. They found Tiflis
situated where the Kura River emerged
from between high bare mountains.</p>

<p>There ended the long tramp of hundreds
of miles, and the boys paused and looked<span class="pagenum">[223]</span>
back at the sky-line of white that marked
the crest of the great Caucasus Range over
which they had climbed. As they looked,
and their minds ran back over the way by
which they had come, the distance to the
Caspian, where they had left the steamer,
seemed infinity.</p>

<p>“I guess it’s a good thing we didn’t know
what was ahead of us when we left Nizhni,
Sid,” said Raymond as they gazed.</p>

<p>“If we had known I don’t believe I should
have been willing to tackle it. But it would
have been easy if we could have come by
wagon through the Dariel Pass, as we
planned.”</p>

<p>At Tiflis the boys saw evidence of war
preparations again, in companies of soldiers
that were passing in the streets. They proceeded
directly to the railway station, where
they tried, without success, to obtain news
of the war. The railway agent replied “Yes”
to every question they asked, but that was
not very enlightening, as their questions
were varied. So they purchased second-class
tickets to Batum, and took the first
train that arrived.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">GOOD-BYE TO RUSSIA</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">The train which the boys boarded was
a very slow one, with, apparently, a
maximum speed of about fifteen miles an
hour; nevertheless it seemed heavenly to
them to have a mode of locomotion other
than that supplied by their own legs. Then,
too, they were alone in the compartment,
and hoped they would continue to be alone
all night. They judged it was quite likely
that they would be, for they observed that
nearly all the passengers on the train went
third class. Raymond declared that that
was where they belonged also, for with the
exposure and hardships of their long journey
their clothes had become very disreputable
in appearance.</p>

<p>Sidney had expected to try to send a cable
from Tiflis to their mother in New York,
but the station agent had exhibited such
density regarding the English language that
he decided to wait until they reached Batum.
He believed that in a seaport they would almost<span class="pagenum">[225]</span>
certainly find some one who could
speak English and who would be willing to
help them, even if the official of the telegraph
office could not be made to understand.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that they did not wait in
Tiflis, for when they arrived at Batum they
learned that the train they were on was the
first one in several days that had been allowed
to carry the general public. It was
not known either how long it would be before
it was followed by another.</p>

<p>Nearly all the trains were being used by
the Government to transport troops that
were being massed at the various Black Sea
ports it was supposed in anticipation of the
opening of hostilities with Turkey. That
country, the boys learned, still remained
neutral, though her purchase from Germany
of two cruisers that had fled for shelter within
the Dardanelles had already nearly precipitated
trouble with Russia.</p>

<p>Sidney and Raymond found their blankets
quite as necessary in a Russian railway
coach as on a Russian mountain. While the
air of the coach was not so cold as that of
the mountain, the surface on which they had<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>
to lie was even harder than the surface of
the Caucasus. With their blankets and their
cloaks and their soft Daghestan rug, however,
they made very comfortable beds on
the long seats which extended in their compartment
across the coach. And with their
acquired ability to sleep wherever they
might make their beds, they were ignorant
of everything that occurred all night, not
being aroused by any of the jolting of stopping
and starting.</p>

<p>In early morning the train approached the
coast of the Black Sea at Poti, several hours
before its arrival at Batum. From that
point the railway ran near the shore and
the boys found much of interest and amusement
in watching the varied scenes of the
waterfront. Upon the arrival of the train at
Batum the boys made their way at once to
the docks, and, with their rolls of blankets
slung over their shoulders, they felt quite as
they imagined emigrants must feel.</p>

<p>There was much freight on the docks,
great stacks of lumber and bales of hides
waiting to be shipped, but there were very
few boats tied up there. The first ship
which they came to was a small steamer<span class="pagenum">[227]</span>
where there were a couple of sailors talking
in a language that sounded strangely familiar
to the boys, and yet which did not seem,
after all, to be one with which they were acquainted.
They stopped and listened and
were more puzzled than ever. Some words
sounded like Spanish spoken with a strong
foreign accent, but the next words would be
entirely strange to them.</p>

<p>“What in creation are they talking, Sid?”
asked Raymond. “Is it Spanish they are
trying to get at?”</p>

<p>“It’s mighty curious Spanish, if it is,” replied
Sidney. “I tell you what, Ray,” he
continued, after a moment of thought, “it
must be Italian. I think that sounds a good
deal like Spanish. I believe I can talk with
them.”</p>

<p>Sidney then asked one of the men in
Spanish where they were going, and the man
replied promptly in his own tongue that they
were going to Rome, a reply of which the
boys gathered the meaning very clearly.</p>

<p>“Gee, Sid,” exclaimed Raymond, “that’s
swell! You talk Spanish and he talks Italian,
and you both understand. Try him
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[228]</span></p>

<p>The next attempt, however, was not so
successful, possibly because Sidney embodied
too much in his question. He asked
the sailor when they were going to leave, and
if he thought their captain would take some
passengers. The man looked puzzled for a
moment, and then replied in a statement
that sounded very long and intricate to the
unlearned ears of the boys. While they were
considering and trying to select words at
whose meaning they might guess, a voice
spoke behind them in perfectly plain English.</p>

<p>“Where do you young gentlemen want to
go?”</p>

<p>The boys wheeled and saw a stocky, middle-aged
man. He wore side whiskers, and
there was something decidedly English in
his appearance.</p>

<p>“We don’t care much where we go,” said
Sidney, “so long as it is west. We want to
get back to New York, but I don’t suppose
we’ll find a ship here for that port.”</p>

<p>“No, you will not, but perhaps I can help
you out. I am Captain Foster, of the
Princess Mary, and I clear in the morning
for Venice.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[229]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, captain,” cried Sidney eagerly, “can
you take us?”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t carry passengers; I have
no place for ’em; but I’d do anything I could
to help Americans to get home. I fancy you
are Americans?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we are,” replied Sidney, “and our
mother is waiting in New York for us.”</p>

<p>Captain Foster looked at the boys curiously.
“If I may be so bold,” he said, “you
are pretty young to be in a country like this
alone, and you look as though you had
traveled some.”</p>

<p>“I should say we had traveled some,”
broke in Raymond, “we came over the
Caucasus.”</p>

<p>“By the Dariel Pass, in a motor-car, I
fancy,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Not much! We hoofed it, by way of
Bezheeta to Tiflis.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean to tell me that you came
over that trail on foot at this time of year?”
And the captain looked at the boys in amazement.</p>

<p>“We sure did,” replied Raymond, “every
step of the way. Don’t those shoes look
like it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[230]</span></p>

<p>And Raymond held up a foot on which
the shoe was barely holding together.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Sidney in explanation,
“we came down the Volga from Nizhni to
Petrovsk, and then across from there. We
started out with horses, but an army officer
took them away from us the first day.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I expect so,” said the captain; “no
man outside of the army can travel horseback
in Russia now.”</p>

<p>“We haven’t heard a thing about the
war,” said Sidney, “since we left the boat.
How is it going?”</p>

<p>“Well, nobody knows yet. It’s a bad
war.” And the captain looked very grave.
“I’d be helping, but I’m too old. And it
begins to look pretty nasty with Turkey;
that’s why I’m clearing in the morning.
But weren’t you with a party?”</p>

<p>“We went with our father to Nizhni to
see the Fair,” replied Sidney, “and father
was arrested as a German spy just because
he speaks German. We were afraid if we
waited we shouldn’t be able to leave Russia
at all, so my brother and I came south, expecting
to go through the Dariel Pass. But
at Petrovsk we were told that troops were<span class="pagenum">[231]</span>
thick in the pass, and were advised not to go
that way. So we came over by the trail, and
it was a tough tramp.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t your father have a passport?”</p>

<p>“Yes, he had a passport from the Secretary
of State at Washington.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure he got out all right, then,” said
the captain. “Americans can go anywhere
in the belligerent countries, if they can only
prove they <em>are</em> Americans. But how did you
young men get away without a passport?”</p>

<p>“The clerk of the hotel, who spoke English,
took my father’s passport down and
showed it to the purser of the boat. And the
chief of police at Petrovsk gave us a sort of a
passport, but it’s in Russian.” And Sidney
took the paper from his pocket and handed
it to the captain.</p>

<p>“I fancy I can read it if it is in Russian,”
said Captain Foster, as he took the paper
and glanced over its contents. “I think
that’ll get you out all right. I’ll take it to
the American Consul and have it viséed, and
then to the chief of police for his O.K. Now,
if you young gentlemen want to make any
purchases,”&mdash;and the captain looked the
boys over with amusement in his eye,&mdash;“you<span class="pagenum">[232]</span>
can do it while I’m getting this fixed
up.”</p>

<p>“I wish we could buy new suits,” said
Sidney, “and shoes; in fact, new outfits
right through, for both of us.”</p>

<p>“You come with me then,” said the captain,
“and I’ll show you a good shop. We
must have everything ready to-day, for I
shall get off in the morning before daylight.”</p>

<p>Captain Foster conducted the boys to a
clothing shop that was kept by an Armenian
Jew who spoke English. Before allowing the
boys to enter, the captain detained them
for final instructions.</p>

<p>“This man has a very good stock of
clothes,” he said. “After you have selected
what you want and got his price for everything,
offer him exactly half what he asks.
If he objects, pretend you’re going to leave
and he’ll come to time fast enough. When
you get through, wait for me here, and I’ll
take you to the ship.”</p>

<p>The boys entered the shop, and informed
the merchant what they wished. They
found, as Captain Foster had said, that the
shop contained an excellent stock of clothing,
and they soon made their selections of a<span class="pagenum">[233]</span>
complete wardrobe for each of them. Then
Sidney asked the merchant how much it all
amounted to.</p>

<p>“As the gentlemen can see,” said the man,
rubbing his hands together and smirking,
“the clothing is most excellent quality.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Sidney, “the clothes are all
right. How much are they?”</p>

<p>“I am sure,” said the merchant, “the
young gentlemen are well pleased.”</p>

<p>“Of course, or we shouldn’t take the
things. Now, tell me how much everything
is, we’re in a hurry.”</p>

<p>The man regarded his customers shrewdly
for a moment, and then said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“The gentlemen may have all of this
clothing, all of the most excellent garments
which they have selected, for the small sum
of one hundred ten rubles.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you just fifty-five rubles for
everything we’ve picked out,” said Sidney.</p>

<p>The man threw up his hands in supplication,
and raised his eyes in horror.</p>

<p>“Would your lordship rob a poor defenseless
man?” he asked, most humbly.</p>

<p>“My lordship doesn’t intend to rob anybody,”
said Sidney, while Raymond snickered.<span class="pagenum">[234]</span>
“But if you don’t want to sell the
things, all right. Come on, Ray.”</p>

<p>The man interposed hastily. “Business is
so bad with the cruel war, that I am willing
to take much less than the clothing is worth.
But fifty-five rubles!” And he raised his
hands in protest.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Sidney, “we’ll go somewhere
else.” And he started toward the door.</p>

<p>“If the gentleman insists,” interposed the
merchant again in a tone of agony, “he
shall have the excellent clothing at his own
price, though I lose half the value of the
goods.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Sidney; “now show us
a place where we can put the things on.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to change your clothes
here, Sid?” objected Raymond.</p>

<p>“Yes; we’d better do the whole thing up
now.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the merchant conducted the
boys to a room at the rear of the shop where
he apparently lived. When the boys were
alone Sidney explained to his brother.</p>

<p>“You see, Ray, my money is all under
my clothes, and I didn’t want to take it out
and let that fellow know how much we’ve<span class="pagenum">[235]</span>
got. Besides, we may as well leave all these
old rags here, they’re good for nothing. I
was ashamed to jew him down that way, but
I guess we paid all the things were worth, or
he wouldn’t have let them go.”</p>

<p>When the boys had changed their clothes
they returned to the shop, and Sidney informed
the merchant that he might have
their old clothes which they had left lying in
the other room. That seemed to satisfy the
man, who was looking as though the boys
had literally robbed him of everything he
possessed. In a few minutes Captain Foster
returned.</p>

<p>“Everything is all right,” he announced,
as they walked toward the docks, “and
when I told your consul, Mr. Davis, what
you boys had done, he said that if you
needed money to get home with to call on
him. I told him you wouldn’t need any
money as far as I went.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine of both of you,” said Sidney,
“but I think we have enough money to pay
our way home. I took your advice about
paying for the clothes, so they didn’t cost
us much, but I felt pretty cheap to beat the
man down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[236]</span></p>

<p>“You needn’t feel cheap,” said the captain;
“if you paid half what he asked, you
paid enough. You don’t look like the same
young men.” And he regarded the boys
with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“I’m glad we look better,” said Sidney,
“and we’ll feel better after we’ve had a
good scrub.”</p>

<p>“You can have a tub,” said the captain,
“as soon as we get to the Princess Mary.”</p>

<p>“There is one other matter,” said Sidney.
“I would like to send a cable to our mother
in New York. We couldn’t make the man
at Tiflis understand, and she must be awfully
anxious about us.”</p>

<p>“I doubt if you can do that,” replied
Captain Foster. “I don’t believe the Government
will allow a message to be sent to a
foreign country, but I’ll go around to the
telegraph office with you and we’ll find out.
You see, when there’s trouble, I don’t have
to wire any owners, for I own the Princess
Mary myself, so I don’t know whether the
wires can be used now or not.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a cargo do you carry, Captain
Foster?” asked Sidney, as they walked
along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[237]</span></p>

<p>“I load with crude oil for Venice.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that an awfully messy cargo?”
asked Raymond.</p>

<p>The captain laughed. “Oh, no; you
wouldn’t know what I had aboard. There
are tanks built into the ship, and the oil is
pumped into them, and pumped out.”</p>

<p>By that time they had arrived at the
telegraph office and the captain interviewed
the man in charge, who spoke no English.
After a short conversation the captain turned
to the boys, and announced, regretfully,&mdash;</p>

<p>“He says you can’t send any message of
any kind out of the country.”</p>

<p>“Poor mother, she will be sick with anxiety.”
And Sidney’s eyes looked suspiciously
moist. “She didn’t want us to come, Captain
Foster. We had a bad time last winter
getting away from the war in Mexico, and
mother was sure something would happen to
us this time, too. But that was before the
war over here began.”</p>

<p>“Well, you know the old saying, ‘No
news is good news.’”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that mother wouldn’t agree
to that. But I guess there’s nothing we
can do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[238]</span></p>

<p>“I fancy you can send a cable from Venice,”
said the captain; “you know Italy is
neutral, like the United States.”</p>

<p>“I do hope we can.” And Sidney looked
somewhat relieved.</p>

<p>They were two rather dejected boys, however,
who turned back to the docks with Captain
Foster. It was very hard to be obliged
to give up all present thought of communicating
with their mother. It seemed ages
since they said good-bye to her in New
York. The anticipation of sending a message
had been so pleasant, and when that
hope was suddenly dashed, their loneliness
and homesickness were greater than ever.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the docks the boys
saw a small, dingy steamer, that ordinarily
would have appeared anything but attractive,
but to the boys then she seemed finer
than a big Atlantic liner. They were taken
on board, and were shown to a tiny cubby-hole
of a cabin that adjoined the captain’s
own stateroom.</p>

<p>“This is not much of a cabin,”&mdash;and the
captain looked about apologetically,&mdash;“but,
you see, the Princess Mary was not intended
to carry passengers.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[239]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, I think it’s fine,” protested Sidney;
and Raymond declared,&mdash;</p>

<p>“It’s perfectly swell! You may have the
lower berth, Sid, and I’ll take the upper
one.”</p>

<p>When the boys had thrown their blankets
into the berths, the captain said,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Now, you come into my cabin; I’ve got
a tub there, and I’ll have the cook bring
you some hot water, and you can scrub as
long as you want to.”</p>

<p>“It’s good of you, Captain Foster,” said
Sidney, “to let us use your bath.”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, the Princess Mary is not
very modern, though she’s as stanch a little
craft as was ever built, and she hasn’t got
any bathrooms. Now you young gentlemen
take your time, and come up on deck when
you’re through. I shan’t come down till I
see you out there.”</p>

<p>Captain Foster’s bath was a funny little
short tub that the bather could just sit down
in. The boys did not try even to sit down,
but stood up, one at a time. There was
plenty of water, however, and soap, and the
scrubbing that followed was very thorough,
and resulted in two well-renovated boys.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span id="Page_240" class="pagenum">[240]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A GREAT DISASTER</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">It had seemed to Sidney and Raymond
that they had attained to the height
of ease when they boarded the train at Tiflis
after their tremendous tramp and were
transported without effort on their part.
But when the Princess Mary drew away
from the pier at Batum and started westward
across the Black Sea, the travelers felt
that they were then enjoying sublimated
luxury.</p>

<p>The great sea lay rippling gently under a
peaceful autumn sky, and the little steamer
drove steadily ahead on a level keel. It was
as though they were navigating a small lake.
Captain Foster’s cargo consisted wholly of
oil, so that he put in at no ports, but made
a straight run from Batum to Venice.</p>

<p>As the Princess Mary used oil for fuel,
her crew was made up chiefly of engineers.
There were only four sailors, one of whom
was the captain’s first officer, and a cook.
The mate, Mr. Wright, sat at the captain’s<span class="pagenum">[241]</span>
table, so with the boys there was a nice little
party of four.</p>

<p>Captain Foster had a great fund of stories
gathered during a sea life of forty years,
and he remembered and was willing to relate
them all. And as the voyage was very
uneventful, the captain’s time was largely
unoccupied, and he employed much of it in
story-telling. So the boys had not a dull
moment.</p>

<p>After two days of such sailing the Princess
Mary entered the Bosporus. It had been
Captain Foster’s custom to stop at Constantinople,
but there had lately been so
many rumors that Turkey was about to join
Germany in the war that he decided to make
no stop on that voyage. The ship, therefore,
was headed to pass directly through, and
the boys thought that they would see the interesting
foreign sights only from a distance.
There was the great city of Constantinople
on one side, and the beautiful heights of
Scutari on the other, both of which places
they would have loved to visit. Then, as
they were passing the entrance to the harbor
of the Golden Horn, a launch flying the
Turkish flag signaled them to stop.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[242]</span></p>

<p>In obedience to the summons Captain
Foster lay to, and they were boarded by a
Turkish officer who demanded their clearance
papers. After he had examined the
papers he went below with Captain Foster
to inspect the cargo.</p>

<p>Sidney and Raymond waited on deck in
great anxiety. They could not face with
equanimity the possibility of being detained
at Constantinople. The narrow straits into
which they had entered seemed to them like
the door through which they would pass for
home, and to have that door close and shut
them out was too dreadful to contemplate.</p>

<p>“Sid,” said Raymond, as they waited in
suspense for the return on deck of the Turkish
officer, “if we are stopped here I shall
escape in some way and swim across to the
other side. If Byron could do that with his
club feet I am sure I can.”</p>

<p>“But Byron, you know, swam across the
other strait, not this one, and that’s probably
narrower.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it’s any narrower than
it is here; why, this is no width at all.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you got across you would still be
in Turkey.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[243]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, but it would be in the country, and
not in a big city.”</p>

<p>“It would be in the country if you could
land outside of Scutari, but that looks like a
pretty big place from here.” And Sidney
gazed across at the heights on the other side
which were covered with buildings.</p>

<p>“I don’t care what there is over there,”
declared Raymond; “there’s one thing sure,
I’m not going to stay in Constantinople.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe they’ll stop us,” said
Sidney; “they’ll be careful how they stop
Americans. But we’ll soon know, for here
comes that Turk.”</p>

<p>The officer approached and looked at the
boys, not unkindly.</p>

<p>“Where are you boys started for?” he
asked in excellent English.</p>

<p>“We are going back to New York,” replied
Sidney.</p>

<p>“Do you live in New York?”</p>

<p>“No; we live in Texas.”</p>

<p>“Texas; that’s a big State. Let’s see
your passport.”</p>

<p>Sidney presented that paper to the officer,
who read it hastily.</p>

<p>“H&mdash;m,” he said, “that’s a curious passport,<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>
but I think it will do. We don’t want
to stop boys, anyway.” Then turning to
Captain Foster, “Your papers are all right,
captain.” And he added significantly, as he
went down the side, “I think there is going
to be a storm; don’t let it catch you in the
Straits, or you might be wrecked.”</p>

<p>As soon as the Turkish officer had left the
ship, Captain Foster sprang to the signal-button
for the engine-room and rang full
speed ahead. The Princess Mary’s screws
churned the water furiously, and she was
soon throwing the spray back from her bows.
But the captain did not appear to be satisfied;
he told the man at the wheel to keep
her well in the middle of the stream, and
rang for greater speed. In obedience to his
demands dense black smoke poured from
the funnel, and the little vessel ploughed
through the water faster than the boys had
supposed could be possible.</p>

<p>“You see the Princess Mary is good for
something, if she is old,” said Captain Foster
proudly as he returned to the boys.</p>

<p>“She can’t go too fast to suit me, captain,”
said Sidney, watching with pleasure
the shores as they glided past.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[245]</span></p>

<p>“Nor me either,” said the captain. “That
officer is an old friend of mine, and he meant
for me to sit up and take notice when he
gave me that warning.”</p>

<p>“About the storm?” asked Raymond. “I
wondered what he meant. It doesn’t look
now as though it would ever storm.”</p>

<p>“He meant something worse than a windstorm,”
said the captain. “But if I can have
until to-morrow morning, they may do what
they please.”</p>

<p>“Do you think Turkey is going into the
war?” asked Sidney.</p>

<p>“I think that’s what they’re getting
ready for,” replied the captain.</p>

<p>“Which side will they join?”</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t be England; I’m sure of
that. They would just love to kick up a fuss
in Egypt.”</p>

<p>Captain Foster kept close watch of the
Princess Mary’s speed, and did not allow the
engines to subside in the least. So long as
they were threading the narrow Strait of the
Bosporus, the boys were kept fully occupied
in watching the various interesting sights
on either side, and the numerous shipping
which they met.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[246]</span></p>

<p>After a time, however, the ship drew out
into the Sea of Marmora, and then there
was less of interest to be seen. The captain,
too, appeared distrait, and was not so good
company as he had been while they were
traversing the Black Sea. So the boys felt
rather dull, and when night came they went
to bed early.</p>

<p>In the morning when the boys looked out
of their porthole of a window, they thought
the ship must be still in the Sea of Marmora,
for there was only water to be seen on either
side.</p>

<p>“I wish this old tub could go faster,” said
Raymond grumblingly. “We’ll never get
to Venice at this rate.”</p>

<p>“She seems to be making good speed,”
said Sidney, as he watched the water surge
past the side of the boat. “I don’t understand
why we aren’t farther along; perhaps
they were obliged to lie to for some reason in
the night.”</p>

<p>The boys dressed rapidly and went out
to hunt Captain Foster, whom they found
pacing the deck and looking very happy.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, captain,” called out the
boys; and Sidney added,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[247]</span></p>

<p>“When shall we reach the Dardanelles?”</p>

<p>“Why, bless you,” replied the captain,
beaming on the boys, “we passed the
Straits last night, and we’re well out in
the Ægean now. What did you think the
Princess Mary had been doing? The old
girl is making twenty-two knots.”</p>

<p>“Jiminy, that’s fine!” exclaimed Raymond;
“then I suppose we’ll round Cape
Matapan to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’re not going to run away down
there. We’ll go through the Corinth Canal;
that will cut off a whole day.”</p>

<p>“Shall we stop at Athens?” asked Raymond
eagerly.</p>

<p>“No, we’ll make no stops, but we’ll be
off Piræus this evening. I shan’t feel really
comfortable till we’re tied up at Venice.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sidney, “that Turkish storm
didn’t materialize.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether it did or not,”
replied the captain; “but if it did we were
beyond it.”</p>

<p>The Princess Mary was too small and unimportant
a craft to carry a wireless, and
since passing the Dardanelles they had met
no vessel within speaking distance. Captain<span class="pagenum">[248]</span>
Foster, therefore, had had no opportunity to
learn what his friend, the Turkish officer, had
meant by the warning he had given. He was,
consequently, feeling rather anxious to know
if he had passed the danger, whatever it was.</p>

<p>The day wore on uneventfully, and the
boys amused themselves as best they might.
They went back and forth from the deck,
where there was nothing of especial interest,
to the engine-room, where there was a good
deal. They were left entirely to their own devices,
for Captain Foster watched the horizon
constantly. He knew there was a possibility
that they might meet an Austrian
cruiser, and in that case he wished to take
advantage of whatever chance there might
be to escape.</p>

<p>Early in the afternoon the captain called
the boys’ attention to the island of Skyros,
which showed off on their right, and he told
them that before long they would see the
mainland of Greece. While they were examining
the horizon Raymond thought he
saw a tiny line of smoke dead ahead. He
called Captain Foster’s attention to it, and
the captain brought his binoculars to bear on
the spot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[249]</span></p>

<p>“It’s not a cruiser,” he announced immediately;
“it’s a tramp steamer. Do you
want to look at her?” And he passed the
glasses over to the boys.</p>

<p>“How can you tell that’s not a cruiser?”
asked Raymond. “I can’t see anything but
a little speck.”</p>

<p>“Well, she’s only got one funnel, for one
thing, and she’s too small for another. She
doesn’t look like any liner, either. I can’t
explain to you exactly how I can tell; I
simply <em>know</em>, that’s all.”</p>

<p>As the approaching ship was coming directly
toward them, she grew large rapidly.
While she was still too small, however, for
the boys to distinguish anything about her,
even with the glasses, Captain Foster examined
her again. He looked intently
through the glasses for a few moments, and
then declared,&mdash;</p>

<p>“It’s the Black Duke, Captain Johnson,
from London to Smyrna.”</p>

<p>“Gee! captain,” exclaimed Raymond;
“you must have second sight. How do you
know what ship that is at this distance?”</p>

<p>“I know her as well as I know the Princess
Mary.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[250]</span></p>

<p>“I couldn’t tell the Princess Mary as far
off as that,” declared Raymond.</p>

<p>“Well, I could. When she comes up I’ll
speak her and we’ll get the news.”</p>

<p>The two ships rapidly drew together, and
laid their courses to pass about one hundred
yards apart. When the Black Duke,
for such the ship was in fact, was still some
three or four hundred yards distant, Captain
Foster took the trumpet and shouted,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ahoy! Black Duke.”</p>

<p>“Ahoy! Princess Mary,” came the answer.</p>

<p>“What news of the war?”</p>

<p>“Turkey closed the Dardanelles this
morning.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” exclaimed Raymond, “that was a
close shave.”</p>

<p>The vessels were now rapidly separating,
but Captain Foster launched one more
question.</p>

<p>“Is the Adriatic safe?”</p>

<p>“English and French cruisers there, Austrian
coast is mined,” was shouted back
from the distance.</p>

<p>Captain Foster lowered the trumpet and
regarded the departing ship thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said finally, “we escaped that<span class="pagenum">[251]</span>
storm, thanks to my Turkish friend. Now
if those mines are stationary, we’ll get
through, but floating mines I’m afraid
of.”</p>

<p>“Do you think Austria would put out
floating mines, captain?” asked Sidney.</p>

<p>“Germany has sowed the North Sea with
floating mines, and Austria may have done
the same thing in the Adriatic. But there
is no way we can locate them, so we’ll just
have to go straight ahead, and take what
comes.”</p>

<p>Having obtained what information he
desired, Captain Foster determined to
crowd the ship forward at top speed. With
Turkey apparently about to join the hostilities
and probably on the side of Germany,
the quicker they were out of the Ægean the
better. While passing through Grecian
waters they would be perfectly safe, and in
the Adriatic the presence of English and
French cruisers would be a great protection,
though they would not insure absolute security.
The most serious aspect of the
whole matter was presented by the mines in
the Adriatic. There was no possibility, however,
of evading, or minimizing, that danger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[252]</span></p>

<p>In early evening the Princess Mary entered
the Gulf of Ægina, and Captain Foster
laid his course directly for the Corinth Canal.
Before they arrived at that cut, however,
night had closed down. The boys remained
on deck to get what impression they might
of the country, but after the ship had traversed
the canal, and entered the Gulf of
Corinth, nothing whatever could be distinguished
on either side. When the boys woke
rather late the next morning the Princess
Mary was passing between the island of
Corfu and the mainland.</p>

<p>“What a measly shame!” exclaimed
Raymond, when he learned where they
were; “here we’ve gone right through the
middle of Greece, and we haven’t been
able to see one foot of it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Sidney, “if we could be set
down in New York now, I’d give up all
chance of seeing any more foreign countries
this trip.”</p>

<p>All that day and all night the Princess
Mary steamed steadily northward. At daylight
on the following day the ship was far
up the Adriatic, opposite the coast of Austria.
When the boys went up on deck they<span class="pagenum">[253]</span>
found Captain Foster standing in the bow
gazing intently out over the water.</p>

<p>“I know I’m silly,” he said when the boys
approached, “but I feel like watching every
minute for mines, though if they were thick
all around us, I shouldn’t know it unless
the Princess Mary struck one.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” said Sidney, “that
mining the sea is a barbarous way to make
war.”</p>

<p>“Yes; but making war any way you
please is all of a piece.”</p>

<p>“Do you think there is really much danger,
captain, that we shall strike a mine?”
asked Raymond. “It would seem like being
pricked by a needle in a haystack.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how great the danger is,”
replied the captain, “but a good many ships
have struck mines and been sunk in the
North Sea. I have been thinking that you
boys ought to know where the life-preservers
are, in case anything does happen. I don’t
think there are any in your room, but there
are some in the main cabin, underneath the
couch. You see the Princess Mary never
carries passengers, and we haven’t paid
much attention to life-preservers. You’d<span class="pagenum">[254]</span>
better get out a couple and bring them up
on deck, then you can get into them in a
jiffy.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you going to get one for yourself,
captain?” asked Raymond.</p>

<p>“No, I think not. If I had one ready I’d
be afraid it would have to be used, and if I
don’t get it maybe I shan’t need it. But
you boys get them; that will be all right.”</p>

<p>The boys hunted out the life-preservers
and took two of them up on deck, placing
them by the side of the companionway,
where they would be easy to grasp in case
of necessity. Then the cook announced
breakfast and they went down to the cabin
with Captain Foster.</p>

<p>They seated themselves at the table and
were seasoning their coffee, when, without
warning, the bow of the ship was thrown
upward with a terrific shock, accompanied
by a muffled roar. The floor of the cabin
inclined at a high angle, sloping down toward
the stem. For a moment the Princess
Mary hung in that terrifying position, while
Captain Foster and the boys clung to the
table, from which all the dishes had been
thrown to the floor. Then the ship settled,<span class="pagenum">[255]</span>
not only into place again, but farther than
she should, so that the floor inclined the
other way.</p>

<p>“Get on deck and into your life-preservers,
boys,” said Captain Foster quietly,
though with a very pale face; “she won’t
last five minutes.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">CASTAWAYS</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">Sidney and Raymond rushed up the
companionway to the deck and began
to buckle on the life-preservers, which were
still lying where they had been placed. Captain
Foster had preceded the boys and was
directing the lowering of a boat, but the
tackle had jammed, and the boat hung in
the air from the davits.</p>

<p>All the small force of men gathered on
deck, including the engineers on duty, whom
the captain had summoned through the
speaking tube. It had been barely a minute
since the explosion, but the Princess Mary
was rapidly settling forward. Three or four
of the men still struggled with the boat,
which obstinately refused to descend to the
water, while others were cutting the lashings
of a life-raft on deck. But the bows of
the ship were already awash, and some of
the oil tanks must have burst and let their
contents out, for the stern rose high in air.</p>

<p>“Let everything go,” ordered Captain<span class="pagenum">[257]</span>
Foster, when he saw the desperate condition
of the vessel, “and jump, as far out from
the ship as you can.”</p>

<p>“Are you ready, Ray?” And Sidney’s
voice shook a little. “Let’s keep together
if we can.”</p>

<p>There was no time, however, for any one
to jump. With not even a quiver the Princess
Mary dove head first into the deep.
The waters sucked down after her with a
strong pull, and then met with a surge
overhead.</p>

<p>When Sidney realized that they would
have no chance to leap for safety, he tried
to grasp his brother, but the suddenly tilting
deck threw him against the side of the
companionway, where he seized the edge of
the opening, and held fast with desperate
energy.</p>

<p>For a moment he had a wild idea that
only by maintaining his hold of the ship
could he be saved, and he clung tenaciously
to the casing. The water surged about him
as he was dragged through it with terrific
force. By closing his mouth tightly he kept
himself from strangling, but the suction and
the pressure were stupefying.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[258]</span></p>

<p>Then it flashed into his mind that he
was being dragged to certain death, instead
of being saved. Instantly he let go. The
speed of the descending vessel had decreased
somewhat with the depth reached, but the
relief of pressure, which had become agonizing,
was heavenly.</p>

<p>For a few moments after Sidney relinquished
his hold he hung wavering in the
wake of the plunging ship, which was still
followed by the eddying currents of water.
Then the buoyancy of his body, together
with that of the life-preserver, shot him upward.
Instinctively, too, he aided that
upward movement by his own effort, the
well-directed effort of a practiced swimmer.</p>

<p>Fortunately there was no wreckage floating
at the spot where he reached the surface,
and what a blessed thing it was to breathe
the air again! The time he was being dragged
down with the ship had been measured by
seconds, but it was quite long enough, when
he was once more in the free air, to make
him feel that he had been restored to life.</p>

<p>Sidney’s presence of mind in keeping his
mouth closed had prevented the water from
entering his lungs, so that he was able<span class="pagenum">[259]</span>
at once to look around to see who else might
be near him. His first thought was of Raymond.
Looking out over the water that was
still agitated by the sinking ship, at first
there was nothing evident but confusion,
for the surface was thickly sprinkled with
wreckage. There was every article that had
been loose on the ship’s deck, to which were
added many pieces of splintered and shattered
planking that had been torn from the
vessel’s bottom by the explosion.</p>

<p>Sidney supported himself by treading
water, and raising himself high, gazed about
him. He saw here and there amidst the
flotsam the head of a man who was clinging
to some piece of wood. Presently, away on
the other side of the circle of waste he saw
his brother.</p>

<p>“O&mdash;h, Ray!” he called.</p>

<p>Raymond, also, was intently examining
the surface of the water, and immediately
he distinguished Sidney.</p>

<p>“I’ll swim over there, Ray,” called Sidney
when he saw that he was observed.</p>

<p>There was no wind, and the waves and
swells caused by the destruction and the
sinking of the Princess Mary were beginning<span class="pagenum">[260]</span>
to subside. So it was not difficult for Sidney
to swim, though he was retarded somewhat
by the cork jacket that was buckled
around him.</p>

<p>He had proceeded but a few strokes when
he noticed, a little to one side, the form of a
man lying against a piece of plank, and he
changed his course to examine it. The man’s
face was in the water, and Sidney, turning
it up, was shocked to find it was Captain
Foster. There was a bloody bruise extending
across his forehead, and he was unconscious,
but Sidney thought he still lived.</p>

<p>“Oh, Ray,” Sidney called, “Captain
Foster is hurt; come and help me.”</p>

<p>The other men who were floating in the
wreckage heard the call, and all hastened
to the aid of their captain. There were the
mate, a sailor, and two engineers, all who
were left of the ship’s company. Mr. Wright
was the first to reach them, and after examining
Captain Foster briefly, he declared,&mdash;</p>

<p>“He’s only stunned, sir, but we must get
him out of the water, or he’ll be chilled.
You men,” he continued, turning to the
others, while he supported himself by a
piece of plank, “get together all the good<span class="pagenum">[261]</span>
pieces of timber you can find, and we’ll
make a raft. I saw a coil of rope just over
there, and maybe you’ll find some more.”</p>

<p>The men, assisted by Sidney and Raymond,
swam through the floating débris,
and collected all the pieces of wood that
were large enough to use. They also found
several long pieces of rope. It was slow
work, and tedious, but fortunately all were
good swimmers. As fast as they brought
the pieces in, pushing them before them to
where Mr. Wright was waiting with Captain
Foster, the mate arranged them in some
sort of order. He tied fragments of about
the same length and width together, and
then placed those couples consecutively and
bound them with the long ropes. There
were two heavy hatch covers, each of which
would easily support a man, and that addition
expedited the work greatly.</p>

<p>Finally the lumber was all collected and
bound together. While not all of it was yet
assembled in the raft, enough of it was put
together to support several men. So the
mate, who was anxious to get the captain
out of the water, climbed up on it and directed
the men from there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[262]</span></p>

<p>“Jack,” he said to the sailor, “you and
Watson,” indicating one of the engineers,
“bring the captain here and we’ll lift him
up.”</p>

<p>The mate had supported Captain Foster
in the water by placing his arms over a
plank and securing them there with a bit of
rope. The two men unbound the lashing,
and placing themselves one on each side of
the injured man, who was still unconscious,
they floated him across the few intervening
yards of space to the raft.</p>

<p>“Now, let me get hold under his shoulders,”
said Mr. Wright, “and you men take
hold of the raft with one hand and lift on
the captain with the other.”</p>

<p>In a few moments Captain Foster was
lying stretched out on the raft, and the
mate turned to Sidney and Raymond.</p>

<p>“If you young gentlemen,” he said, “will
climb up here and chafe the captain’s hands,
I’ll help the men and we’ll soon have the
raft done. Take off his shoes, too, and rub
his feet till they’re warm and dry. He must
have been thrown against a timber when
the ship plunged down, and was unconscious
when he struck the water. So there’ll<span class="pagenum">[263]</span>
be no water in his lungs, and all you’ll have
to do will be to get him warm. I wish we
had some brandy to give him, but we haven’t
even got water.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Sidney, who had climbed up
and was kneeling by the captain’s side,
“and Captain Foster didn’t have any
breakfast this morning, and I think he was
so worried last night that he didn’t eat
much dinner, so he won’t be in good shape
to get his strength back.”</p>

<p>“Did you young gentlemen have any
breakfast?”</p>

<p>“No, we didn’t have any either. The
explosion came just as we sat down to the
table.”</p>

<p>“That’s bad; we men ate a good meal.
Well, we may not be kept here long.”</p>

<p>When Mr. Wright and his men had bound
together all of the lumber which had been
collected, they had a commodious, serviceable
raft. It consisted of a double tier of
heavy timbers all through, and rode high in
the water, even when it carried all seven of
the party.</p>

<p>The boys had worked faithfully over
Captain Foster, but he still had not recovered<span class="pagenum">[264]</span>
consciousness, though his body had
become much warmer. The sky was clear,
and a bright sun had done quite as much as
the boys’ vigorous rubbing to bring about
that condition. Mr. Wright examined the
unconscious man more carefully than he had
done at first, and was quite sure that the
skull had not been injured by the blow
which he had received.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe there is anything more
we can do,” said the mate, “but I think he
will come to himself before long. We’d better
all take off our clothes and dry them in
the sun. I ought to have taken off some of
the captain’s clothes; he would have warmed
up quicker; I believe I’ll do it now.”</p>

<p>He began to remove Captain Foster’s
jacket, and as he stooped over him to release
an arm the captain opened his eyes.</p>

<p>“How many of the men were saved?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Three,” replied the mate.</p>

<p>“Who were they?”</p>

<p>“Jack, Watson, and Smith.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” said the captain fervently;
“they are three of the men with families.
And the passengers?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[265]</span></p>

<p>“Both of them,” replied the mate.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of that. What are we on?”</p>

<p>“We built a raft,” said the mate, “from
the wreckage.”</p>

<p>“You’re a capable man, Mr. Wright,”
said the captain. “My head feels pretty
level now. I fancy I can sit up.” And he
proceeded to do so.</p>

<p>Sidney and Raymond and the three men
gathered around the captain and expressed
their delight at his recovery.</p>

<p>“Gee! captain,” exclaimed Raymond,
“we’re glad to hear you talking.”</p>

<p>“And I’m glad to see you, my boy,” said
the captain. “This is pretty hard luck for
you boys, just as you thought you were getting
out.”</p>

<p>“Don’t think about us, captain,” said
Sidney; “it’s you and your crew who have
met with hard luck.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the captain, “we have to
take it as a part of the day’s work.”</p>

<p>“I hated awfully,” said Raymond, “to
lose that fine rug that we packed over the
mountains for our mother, and my revolver,
too.”</p>

<p>“You won’t need your revolver again,”<span class="pagenum">[266]</span>
said Captain Foster, “but if we’re taken by
the Austrians the rug might have come in
handy. I only hope that we’ll not be picked
up by an Austrian boat.”</p>

<p>“What would they do with us?” asked
Raymond.</p>

<p>“You boys would probably not be held,
but the rest of us would be sent to a detention
camp. They would never let Englishmen
get back home.”</p>

<p>“And not be released until the war is
over?”</p>

<p>“I fancy not.”</p>

<p>“Gee!” said Raymond, “that would
be tough. Why, the war may last a month
or two yet.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Captain Foster, “or a year
or two.”</p>

<p>“Captain,” asked Raymond, “do you
remember when the ship went down?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not,” replied Captain Foster.
“When she made her first plunge, I was
thrown against the rail, and that was the
last I knew.”</p>

<p>“I remember everything I did,” said
Raymond, “but I didn’t go down very far
till I began to come up again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[267]</span></p>

<p>“The suction from a small boat like the
Princess Mary is not very great,” said the
captain, “but if it had been a big liner, you
wouldn’t have come up, that is, not alive.”</p>

<p>“Then why didn’t the other men reach
the surface too?” asked Sidney.</p>

<p>“Because they probably became entangled
in some way and were held down,” replied
the captain. “Poor fellows! the sea is
relentless, as only those know who follow it.”</p>

<p>The outer clothing of the castaways,
which they had removed, was become quite
dry in the sun, and they felt more cheerful.
But while they were glad of the warm sun
at first, they soon saw the possibility of its
becoming too warm for comfort. Besides,
the warmer they became the more their
minds turned to the thought of water, of
which there was none.</p>

<p>The injury to Captain Foster’s head was
wholly superficial, but it gave him a very
sanguinary appearance, for it could not be
cleansed, and there was no possible bandage
for it except salt-soaked handkerchiefs.
The captain, however, soon felt quite like
himself again, for, as he said, he was altogether
too tough to be permanently knocked<span class="pagenum">[268]</span>
out by anything so trivial as a little blow on
the head.</p>

<p>He noticed that what little breeze there
was came from the east, and that fleecy
clouds were gathering in that quarter, indicating
the approach of a storm. He called
the mate’s attention to that, and said he
felt uneasy about their condition if there
should be a storm.</p>

<p>“I believe, Mr. Wright,” the captain finally
suggested, “that we can rig up a sail to
help us toward the coast of Italy.”</p>

<p>“We don’t seem to have much to make a
sail of, sir.”</p>

<p>“We could use our coats if we had any
way to fasten them together.”</p>

<p>“There’s a coil of ratline-stuff, sir, that we
fished out of the water, and that I thought
was too small to trust in making the raft.”</p>

<p>“That’s just the thing, Mr. Wright.
Make holes along the edges of the coats and
tie them together with bits of the cord.
Then pull out the two longest sticks you can
find in the top of the raft. Hoist those
sticks a little ways apart, jam the ends down
between the timbers, and spread the sail
between them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[269]</span></p>

<p>All went to work with a will, the boys tying
the coats together, and the men getting
out the sticks for masts and setting them in
position. Soon there was a curious patchwork
quilt of a sail raised, but one that
offered a large surface to the breeze. Raymond
stationed himself at the edge of the
raft, and trailing his hand in the water for
a log, announced gleefully,&mdash;</p>

<p>“We’re making two knots.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="cheaderfont">A RESCUE</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">While Raymond had declared jokingly
that they were making two
knots, it was probably a fact that they were
not going so fast as that. The raft, however,
with its broad sail before an increasing
breeze, was moving through the water at a
rate that was perceptible, and that, to their
joy, was taking them toward a safe, neutral
country.</p>

<p>A few thin gray clouds were coming in
from the east, but the sun was still warm
and invited to ease and comfort. So the
various members of the little party stretched
themselves out as best they might. There
was nothing, however, to mitigate the hardness
of the surface on which they lay, except
their own will to endure it.</p>

<p>“After all,” said Raymond, “this beats
some of the beds we had in the Caucasus.”</p>

<p>“That must have been a tough tramp for
you boys,” said Captain Foster.</p>

<p>“It was,” replied Sidney, “and if we had<span class="pagenum">[271]</span>
known just how hard it would be, I think we
should not have attempted it.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Raymond, “we were never
blown up at any rate. I hope the raft won’t
strike another mine; it would be our finish
if it did.”</p>

<p>“That is not likely,” said the captain.
“It is strange that even one mine should
have floated out so far from the Austrian
coast.”</p>

<p>As the day advanced, the wind increased
and the raft ceased to be a stable vehicle.
It pitched and rolled altogether too much
for comfort. The occupants of the raft, too,
became very thirsty, and Captain Foster
and the boys, who had missed their breakfast,
added the pangs of hunger to the
misery of thirst.</p>

<p>Hunger and thirst, however painful,
might be borne, but the endurance of the
raft in a gale was an undetermined problem.
It was a problem, though, that promised to
press for solution, for the wind continued to
increase, and the clouds rolled up dark and
darker from the east. The raft plunged
heavily and sullenly through the rising sea.</p>

<p>Finally, Captain Foster ordered the sail<span class="pagenum">[272]</span>
down, and the coats restored, each to its
owner. It was high time that the coats were
made to perform their proper office again,
for the wind had become very cold, and the
spray constantly drenched the occupants of
the raft. The sail, too, must soon have been
torn away if it had not been taken down.</p>

<p>Soon after noon the wind had risen to a
gale, and instead of lying stretched in a warm
sun on a placid sea, the shipwrecked party
were huddled together under a cold and
lowering sky. They crouched in silence, for
no one felt like talking.</p>

<p>When the raft made an especially violent
plunge and nearly stood on edge, they all
clutched each other, and by their very bulk
maintained their position. At one such
time, however, <a id="Ref_272" href="#Ref_272a">Sidney failed to grasp the
man who was next him, and slid to the
edge</a>. He only saved himself there by seizing
hold of a stick which protruded a little
above the level of the raft.</p>

<div id="Ref_272a" class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i272.jpg" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="center"><a href="#Ref_272">SIDNEY SLID TO THE EDGE</a></p></div>
</div>

<p>The boy was so nearly paralyzed by fright
that when the raft settled to a level again,
he could not get back to the center until he
was pulled in by one of the men.</p>

<p>“It won’t do to take such chances as<span class="pagenum">[273]</span>
that,” said Captain Foster. “Mr. Wright,
knot together the pieces of rope that we
used in the sail. Then tie one end to one
edge of the raft, bring it across the center
and tie to the other side. We’ll all take hold
of that, and we shan’t be washed off.”</p>

<p>The mate found there was enough rope to
extend across the raft and pass back again,
making it double. He also fastened the
middle to the raft, and had a secure anchor.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” said Captain Foster,
“grasp the line, and don’t let go for an instant.”</p>

<p>Sidney’s narrow escape was all the warning
that was necessary to make the boys,
even Raymond, obey implicitly. The men
did not need any warning for caution, for
their experience of the ocean was sufficient
to show them their danger. So all the members
of the party gripped the rope with the
tenacity of fear.</p>

<p>The supporting rope had not been provided
any too soon, for the gale increased in
intensity. Indeed the strength of the unfortunates
who clung to the rope was sometimes
taxed to the utmost to enable them to
maintain their hold. Without that support<span class="pagenum">[274]</span>
they would certainly have been washed
away.</p>

<p>The raft would sometimes be dashed up
on the crest of a great wave with such force
that it seemed in imminent danger of being
thrown over backward. Then it would be
hurled down into the trough of the sea, and
be threatened with destruction by the waves
that reared on either side.</p>

<p>As the wind increased, too, the clouds
became more dense, and began to discharge
dashes of biting rain. The rain itself did not
make so much difference, however, for the
shipwrecked people were already as wet,
from the drenching spray, as they could be.
But with the rain came bitter cold, and that
was heart-breaking.</p>

<p>It had been difficult enough for the castaways
to keep hold of the rope with the pitching
and rolling of the raft. That difficulty
was increased many fold by the cold that
numbed their hands and sapped their
strength. Even the sailors, with the hardihood
acquired during years of hardships,
found the situation a difficult one. And the
boys, despite their severe schooling in endurance,
found it nearly insupportable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[275]</span></p>

<p>Raymond’s hands became absolutely devoid
of feeling, and his whole body was almost
without sensation. His grasp on the
rope held more because his fingers were
stiffening in their clutch than because of any
volition on his part. He hung, almost insensible,
from the rope.</p>

<p>Finally, Captain Foster noticed the boy’s
condition, and cast about for a way to help
him. He thought he might hold Raymond,
himself, with one arm, but he hardly dared
trust the weight of both of them to the insecure
support of one hand. If there were
only a line to tie him fast!</p>

<p>“Mr. Wright,” he said to the mate, “we
must do something for the boy, or he will
be washed away. Is there any line left?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied the mate. “Yes, I
think there is, too,” he added. “When I
lashed the center of the line down to the
raft, there was a long end which I left hanging.
It’s right by the boys.”</p>

<p>When the members of the party had
ranged themselves along the rope anchor,
Sidney and Raymond were placed in the
center as the most secure position.</p>

<p>“Then I wish you’d work your way in<span class="pagenum">[276]</span>
there, Mr. Wright, and tie that boy to the
line,” said the captain.</p>

<p>“Aye, that I will, sir,” replied Wright.</p>

<p>The mate, who was near one end, climbed
cautiously past the other man until he
reached Raymond. Then he knotted the
long loose end of line around the boy’s body
under his arms in such a way that it could
not draw tight, and yet so securely that
Raymond could not be washed off. When
that was done, he found there was still rope
left, and he said to Sidney,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Shall I lash you too, sir? It will be safer.”</p>

<p>“I wish you would,” replied Sidney. “I
may be able to hold on, but I am not sure.
Thank God, my brother is safe.”</p>

<p>It was not long after that when Raymond’s
hands lost their grip and he hung, an
inert weight, from the rope. Then, after the
raft was free of a towering wave that had
broken over it, Smith’s place was vacant.
When Captain Foster discovered their loss,
he besought the men who were left to have
courage.</p>

<p>“Don’t lose heart,” he said to them.
“Watson, remember your family, and,
Jack, that old mother of yours. I think we<span class="pagenum">[277]</span>
must be in the route from Fiume to Ancona,
and there may be some traffic yet between
Austria and Italy, so I fancy we stand a
good chance of being picked up.”</p>

<p>“I shall hang on, sir,” replied Watson,
“as long as any one. My missus can’t support
the children alone.”</p>

<p>As the man finished speaking, the raft
mounted the crest of a huge swell, and the
mate and Jack sang out simultaneously,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Ship ahoy!”</p>

<p>There was barely time to see a steamer
that was bearing down upon them not far
away, when the raft plunged into the trough
again. With the next rise, however, there
was a good view of a long steamer with four
funnels, that lay low in the water, coming up
against the wind.</p>

<p>“It’s a destroyer,” said Captain Foster,
“probably an Austrian. Well, better an
Austrian than none at all.”</p>

<p>The castaways were observed, and the
warship, after passing close to one side, hove
to so as to bring the raft under her lee.
There she hung, with her engines working
only enough to hold against the wind, while
she lowered a boat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[278]</span></p>

<p>The shipwrecked men watched anxiously
while the boat fought its way toward
them. It was thrown from crest to trough,
then back again, and tossed about until it
seemed impossible that it could live. There
was no trouble about its being able to advance,
for the wind swept it resistlessly
along. The greatest danger was that it
would strike the raft and both be wrecked.</p>

<p>When the boat was opposite the raft its
crew attempted to bring it up to the wind.
As they came around and the gale struck
them broadside on, it seemed as though
their destruction was certain. For a few
moments the boat was hidden beneath the
piling seas, and Captain Foster and his men
held their breath in terrible suspense.</p>

<p>Then the boat emerged, but the wind had
driven it past its destination. Slowly the
boat’s crew battled their way back against
the gale. When they were once more opposite,
they drew the boat up on the windward
side, and let it down as carefully as possible
against the raft.</p>

<p>The protection which the warship offered
in breaking the force of the wind was considerable,
but even then the two craft<span class="pagenum">[279]</span>
pounded together in a most alarming manner.</p>

<p>The mate cut the cord that held Sidney,
and he and Captain Foster helped the boy
to the side. Sidney had not been, like his
brother, rendered entirely helpless by the
cold, and the prospect of rescue had greatly
restored his strength. So by watching until
the boat and the raft, in their violent oscillations,
were brought to nearly the same
level, he was able to spring into the boat,
where he was caught by its crew and placed
in safety.</p>

<p>Then Captain Foster and the mate turned
to Raymond. He was unconscious, and
they were obliged to carry him, which was
extremely difficult. They left the cord attached
to the boy, and threw the end to the
boat’s crew, who held it as a safeguard
against disaster. By lifting and pulling,
Raymond was transferred safely to the boat.</p>

<p>When that had been accomplished it was
comparatively easy for the sailors to follow
the boys, and the boat started back to the
ship. That was a long pull and a hard one,
but the nearer they approached under the
lee of the ship the less difficult it became,<span class="pagenum">[280]</span>
and the shipwrecked party were finally safe
on board.</p>

<p>Captain Foster and the boys were conducted
to the cabin of one of the officers,
where Raymond received the attention of
the ship’s surgeon. And the mate and his
men were taken forward. Warmth and food
were all that Raymond needed to restore
him completely, and the others responded
to the same treatment.</p>

<p>Captain Foster learned that the ship
which had rescued them was the Salzburg,
an Austrian torpedo boat destroyer, which
was doing patrol duty from Pola as a base.
Presently they were visited by the lieutenant
in command, a courteous young man
who spoke English perfectly.</p>

<p>“What ship are you from?” he asked
Captain Foster.</p>

<p>“The Princess Mary, freighter, from Batum
to Venice,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Were you wrecked in the storm?”</p>

<p>“No, we struck a mine early this morning.”</p>

<p>“And these young men?”</p>

<p>“They are Americans who were returning
home from Russia, and I was helping them
out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[281]</span></p>

<p>“Well, captain,” said the lieutenant, “I
shall be obliged to detain you and your men.
I will turn you over to the commandant at
Pola. But I will see that these young Americans
are sent on by rail. If you have money
to get to Genoa,” he continued, turning to
Sidney, “you will find ships that will take
you to England, and from there you can
easily get home.”</p>

<p>“I think we have money enough for
that,” replied Sidney, “and we shall never
forget what you have done for us.”</p>

<p>“I have done only my duty,” replied the
officer as he turned away.</p>

<p>“It distresses me, Captain Foster,” said
Sidney when they were alone, “to leave you
a prisoner.”</p>

<p>“That you can’t help, my friend,” replied
the captain, “and it is a chance that we
took with our eyes open.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we take a letter for you to your
family?” asked Sidney.</p>

<p>“I shan’t give you a letter; that would
only get you into trouble; but when you
reach London, I’ll be grateful if you will go
to see my wife, at No. 18, Southampton
Row, Russell Square. You can tell her just<span class="pagenum">[282]</span>
what has happened to me, and where you
left me, and that will be a great comfort to
her.”</p>

<p>“I will do that, certainly,” said Sidney.</p>

<p>The boys had no further opportunity for
conversation with Captain Foster, for men
came to take them to a separate room. And
in the morning they had only a glimpse of
their benefactor before they were put
aboard a train at Pola for the Italian frontier,
where they would transfer to another
train for Genoa.</p>

<p>“Gee! Sid,” said Raymond, when they
were speeding along in the train, “this
beats tramping over the Caucasus.”</p>

<p>“It sure does,” replied Sidney, “and I
guess we’ve done our last tramping this
trip.”</p>

<p>“It really looks now,” said Raymond,
“as though we were going to see mother,
after all. When we were on that raft I
thought we never should again.”</p>

<p>“And I hope we’ll find father with her
in New York,” said Sidney.</p>
